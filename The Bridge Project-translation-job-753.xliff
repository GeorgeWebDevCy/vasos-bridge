Social media helps us stay in touch with family and friends, learn new things, and feel connected. But not everyone online is kind or honest. Because anyone can use social media, it’s important to know how to protect yourself.

This unit will show you the most common online risks: sharing too much personal information, phishing messages, fake profiles, cyberbullying, and false or misleading news. By understanding these dangers, you can make safer choices online. You will learn how to keep your privacy safe, avoid scams, and feel more confident when using social media to connect, learn, or share.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - Personal Information</h2>
<h3>What is personal information?</h3>
Personal information is any detail that can tell others who you are, where you live, or what your life is like. This can be about you, your family, or even your friends.

Some examples of personal information <em>(please find more information in Module 1, Unit 1)</em>: your full name, home address, phone number, email address, photos of yourself or your children, where you work, where your children go to school, your id or passport number, your birthday.

Before sharing anything online, ask yourself: <em>“Would I share this with a stranger on the street?”</em>
If the answer is no, then it’s better not to post it.

Many people use social media to connect and share. But not everyone online has good intentions. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you share too much personal information, it could be misused.</span>

<strong>For example:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Someone could use your details to try to log into your accounts.</li>
 	<li>A photo in front of your home can show your address.</li>
 	<li>Sharing your birthday and full name can help someone guess your passwords.</li>
 	<li>Posting travel plans tells others your home is empty.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes people online pretend to be friendly, but only want to collect information about you. That’s why it’s important to think before sharing.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 2 - Phishing Messages and Fake Profiles</h2>
You should not trust people you only know from the internet. Not everyone is who they say they are. Some people use fake names or profiles, or send messages that look real but are made to trick you. This is called <strong>phishing</strong> – when someone pretends to be a trusted person or organisation to try to steal your personal information, like your password, phone number, or bank details.
<h3>The story behind the name “Phishing”</h3>
The name phishing sounds similar to fishing, because just like fishing in a sea, scammers "fish" for your personal data from a sea of users. The use of “ph” instead of “f” comes from the old hacker culture, where hackers were called phreaks — a term from phreaking, which meant hacking telephone systems. A famous hacker, John Draper (also known as Captain Crunch), popularized this term in the 1970s.
<h3>How phishing messages look like?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>A message that says, “You won a prize! Click here!”</li>
 	<li>An email or post that asks, “We need your bank info to fix a problem.”</li>
 	<li>A message from someone pretending to be a friend asking for money</li>
 	<li>A person you just met online asking for private photos or information</li>
</ul>
These messages often look official, but they are fake. They may use a company logo or your friend’s photo. The goal is to trick you into sharing information.

This is also connected to the fake profiles – the profiles made by someone pretending to be another person. They usually use stolen photos, fake job titles, or copied information and they seem real. Their goal is often to get your trust and then ask for something—money, private details, or access to your contacts.

If someone sends you a message that feels strange, don’t click on links or answer quickly. Ask a real friend or trusted person first. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 3 - Cyberbullying</h2>
If someone online on social media is hurting you or threaten or embarrass you through messages, photos, videos or comments, it is called <strong>cyberbullying</strong>. It can happen in many ways, such as someone writing mean things about you, making fun of your photo, spreading lies, or sending you scary messages.

It can be someone who you may know but it can be a stranger from the internet. It makes people sad, scared, or alone. It is important to know that it is not your fault, and you are not alone.

<strong>If something similar is happening to you, this is what you have to do:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Do not answer or fight back:</em></strong> Responding can make the situation worse. Bullies often want a reaction. If you stay silent, they may lose interest.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Take a screenshot of the messages:</em></strong> This is important because you can show it to someone you trust or report it. It is proof of what happened.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Block the person who is sending them:</em></strong> Most social media platforms allow you to block users. This stops them from contacting you or seeing your posts.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Report the bullying to the platform (like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or others):</em></strong> You can report bullying to the platform (like Facebook, Instagram, etc.). They can remove the content or block the bully.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Talk to someone you trust, like a teacher, a support worker, or a friend:</em></strong> You don’t have to deal with this alone. A friend, family member, or support organisation can help you and give advice.</li>
</ul>
You have the right to feel safe online, just like in real life. No one should make you feel bad or scared through messages or posts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 4 - Fake News and Misinformation</h2>
There are so many people on social media and not everyone shares only things which are true. Sometimes people share fake news – stories or pictures that are not real. They can be made to trick you, scare you, or make you believe something that isn’t true.

But there are different types of information problems, and it’s important to understand the differences between them.
<h4>Key Term:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Fake news:</em></strong> Intentionally false or misleading information that looks like real news. Its goal is often to influence public opinion, create strong emotions, or gain profit (like clicks).</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Misinformation:</em></strong> False or misleading information that is shared without the intention to deceive. For example, sharing an old article thinking it is current.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Disinformation:</em></strong> Deliberately created and spread false information aimed at misleading, manipulating, or harming people.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Malinformation:</em></strong> True information that is shared out of context or with the intention to harm (for example, leaking sensitive personal data).</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Related Concepts</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong><em>Clickbait:</em></strong> Sensational or misleading headlines designed to get people to click, often without caring about the truth of the content.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Hoax:</em></strong> A deliberate lie or prank meant to confuse or entertain people, often spread through social media or email chains.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Propaganda:</em></strong> Systematic spreading of information (often incomplete or misleading) to influence public opinion or political attitudes.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Troll / Trolling:</em></strong> Provocative or intentionally harmful behaviour online, often to disrupt discussions, create conflict, or confuse others.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Deepfake:</em></strong> Technology using artificial intelligence to create fake videos or audio where a person appears to say or do something they never actually did.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Echo chamber:</em></strong> A situation where a person is only exposed to opinions that match their own, limiting access to different perspectives.</li>
 	<li><strong><em>Information disorder:</em></strong> An umbrella term for various forms of information manipulation (including misinformation, disinformation, malinformation, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Here are some tips to spot fake news:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Check who posted it – is it a real and known source?</li>
 	<li>Look at the date – is the information old or new?</li>
 	<li>Does it try to make you angry or scared? Be careful – fake news often plays with emotions.</li>
 	<li>Can you find this news on other trusted websites?</li>
 	<li>Are there spelling mistakes or strange language?</li>
</ul>
You don’t have to believe or share everything. If you're not sure, ask someone you trust or don’t share it at all.
