<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built a solid foundation for understanding digital wellbeing, Unit 2 turns to a critical challenge: recognising when our digital habits start to become unhealthy. This unit focuses on identifying the signs and symptoms of digital overload&mdash;such as mental fatigue, emotional exhaustion, and reduced focus&mdash;that often go unnoticed until they affect our health and performance. You'll explore how stress builds up in digital environments and what psychosocial risks contribute to burnout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2.1 Signs and Symptoms of Digital Burnout</h2>
<h3>What Is DigitaL Burnout?</h3>
<p>You may have heard of burnout&mdash;a state of physical, mental, and emotional exhaustion that results from prolonged, unmanaged stress, particularly in work environments. As its prevalence continues to rise, the World Health Organization officially classified burnout as an occupational phenomenon in 2019.</p>
<p>In the digital age, however, burnout isn't just tied to long office hours or difficult work tasks. Increasingly, people experience what is now called digital burnout&mdash;a condition brought on by excessive time spent on screens, especially when the boundaries between work, learning, and leisure begin to blur. Digital burnout often emerges when we find it difficult to disconnect from our devices, constantly switching between work emails, social media, online meetings, and digital notifications.</p>
<p>When it comes to age, Europeans between 25 and 34 years old appear especially vulnerable, with an alarming 72 % reporting experiences of burnout (STADA Health Report). Moreover, workplace environments also play a significant role: around half of European workers are exposed to psychosocial risks (PSR)&mdash;including high workloads, lack of support, and blurred boundaries between work and private life (Social Europe). <strong><a href="https://gradsingapore.com/graduate-careers-advice/early-career/understanding-and-avoiding-digital-burnout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>But how do you know if you&rsquo;re affected?</strong> The signs aren&rsquo;t always obvious at first&mdash;but they build up over time. <strong><a href="https://ict-pulse.com/2021/02/digital-burnout-what-are-the-signs-and-how-you-can-fight-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a><br></strong><br><strong>1. Constant Exhaustion:</strong> You feel tired all the time, even after rest or sleep. Everyday tasks may suddenly feel overwhelming, and your energy levels stay low.<br><br><strong>2. Anxiety and Low Mood:</strong> You might feel more worried, irritable, or down than usual. Notifications and online pressure can cause stress or trigger mood swings, making it harder to relax.<br><br><strong>3. Loss of Interest or Motivation:</strong> Things you used to enjoy&mdash;like hobbies, work, or online activities&mdash; feel dull or meaningless. You may even start to feel emotionally distant or unmotivated.<br><br><strong>4. Trouble Focusing:</strong> Concentration becomes difficult. You may notice memory problems, slower thinking, or feeling mentally scattered&mdash;especially when multitasking online.<br><br><strong>5. Physical Complaints:</strong> Headaches, back pain, sleep problems, or even stomach issues can show up. Some people also feel physical tension or notice changes in eating or sleep habits.<br><br><strong>6. Withdrawing Socially: </strong>Even though you're constantly connected online, you might feel lonely or disconnected. Face-to-face conversations may feel draining or less frequent.<br><br><strong>7. Avoidance Behaviours:</strong> You start putting off tasks, delaying responses to messages, or avoiding certain platforms because it all feels &ldquo;too much.&rdquo;<br><br><strong>8. Feeling Unproductive:</strong> Despite spending hours online, you may feel like you&rsquo;re not achieving much. This sense of inefficiency can lead to frustration or self-doubt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2.2 Work-ReLated Stress and PsychosociaL Risks in the DigitaL Age</h2>
<p>Work-related stress is more than just a busy week or looming deadline. It refers to the harmful physical and emotional reactions that can occur when job demands exceed a person&rsquo;s capacity, resources, or needs. Unlike positive work challenges that can motivate us, stress in this context can lead to reduced wellbeing, poor performance, and even long-term health issues.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to distinguish challenge from stress. Challenges in the workplace can be stimulating&mdash; they push us to develop skills, solve problems, and reach goals. When we rise to a challenge, it often brings a sense of satisfaction and growth. That&rsquo;s likely what people mean when they say, &ldquo;a little bit of stress is good for you.&rdquo; But when the pressure becomes overwhelming or prolonged, and when individuals lack control or support, it turns into harmful stress&mdash;not motivation. <strong><a href="https://osha.europa.eu/en/themes/psychosocial-risks-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<h3><br>Psychosocial risks and stress at work</h3>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s take a closer look at the psychosocial risks behind unhealthy work stress. These risks don&rsquo;t come from individual weakness - they are rooted in how work is designed, organised, and managed. When these systems fail, the consequences can include burnout, anxiety, depression, or physical illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common risk factors include: <strong><a href="https://osha.europa.eu/en/themes/psychosocial-risks-and-mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive workloads and unrealistic deadlines Unclear roles or conflicting demands</li>
<li>Lack of autonomy and decision-making power</li>
<li>Poor communication and low support from supervisors or colleagues Constant organisational changes or job insecurity</li>
<li>Harassment or workplace violence (including third-party aggression)</li>
</ul>
<p>For&nbsp;organisations and teams, recognising these risk factors is the first step in preventing stress and promoting a healthy, productive work environment.</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="4.2 Unit 2 - Stress" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/4.2-Unit-2-Stress.webp?t=1757971033" alt="" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2.3 What Is Stress Risk Assessment and Why It Matters</h2>
<p>Before we talk about how to assess stress risks, we need one important thing: awareness.<br>Many people&mdash;whether students, educators, or employees&mdash;are not fully aware of what psychosocial risks are or why work-related stress needs to be addressed. That&rsquo;s why the first step in any stress risk assessment is to raise awareness and build shared understanding. When people understand what causes digital and mental strain, they are more likely to take action to prevent it. <strong><a href="https://www.peninsulagrouplimited.com/topic/health-and-safety/risk-assessment/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p><br>➡️ For example, stress can come from constant notifications, high workload, unclear roles, or poor communication. If we don&rsquo;t talk about these things openly, it&rsquo;s hard to manage them effectively.</p>
<p>➡️ The level of formality depends on the context: a small team might handle things informally, while larger organisations may need clearer structures. But no matter the size, writing things down&mdash;even simple agreements&mdash;can help make everyone&rsquo;s roles and responsibilities clear.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>What is a stress risk assessment?</h3>
<p>For the European Agency for Safety and Health (EU-OSHA), it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cornerstone of the European approach to preventing occupational accidents and ill health;</li>
<li>a dynamic process that allows enterprises and organisations to put in place a proactive policy for managing workplace risks;</li>
<li>the first step required for managing psychosocial risks leading to stress: identifying hazards and assessing the extent of any risk arising.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the risk assessment process is not done well or not done at all, the appropriate preventive measures are unlikely to be identified or put in place. That is why risk assessment is so important, as the key to healthy workplaces. <strong><a href="https://www.peninsulagrouplimited.com/guide/how-to-complete-a-risk-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p>Stress risk assessment is a process used to identify and manage risks that may harm people&rsquo;s wellbeing - especially in digital or work-related settings. It's particularly relevant today, as blurred lines between work and personal life can lead to mental overload.</p>
<p>It helps us reflect on:</p>
<ul>
<li>What tasks or habits may cause stress or harm?</li>
<li>Can we avoid or reduce these risks?</li>
<li>What actions can make our routines healthier?</li>
<li>Are our strategies working?</li>
<li>Are we reviewing and improving them regularly?</li>
</ul>
<p>The&nbsp;purpose of stress risk assessments is twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>to identify and prevent harm to the health, safety, and welfare of the workforce;</li>
<li>to enable the employer to take the measures necessary for the safety and health protection of workers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The International Labour Organization provides <strong><a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/labour-administration-inspection/resources-library/publications/guide-for-labour-inspectors/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information </a></strong>on the management of occupational safety and health (OSH) issues that are that are common across many sectors of industry. Have a look at it!</p>
<p>Where elimination of risks is not possible, the risks should be reduced and the residual risk controlled.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, depression will become the leading cause of the global disease burden!!!!!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2.4 Self-care as an essential solution to beating burnout</h2>
<p>Burnout doesn&rsquo;t just come from external pressure like heavy workloads or digital overload - it can also be the result of internal factors, such as poor self-care or lack of awareness about one's own needs. Especially in digital learning or hybrid work settings, many people forget to pause and check in with themselves.</p>
<p>One common challenge is that people may not notice early warning signs until stress becomes overwhelming. That&rsquo;s where awareness plays a crucial role. Once you recognise how your digital habits or environment affect your wellbeing, you can take steps to reduce the pressure. Some helpful actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting regular physical activity</li>
<li>Creating a consistent sleep routine</li>
<li>Setting boundaries between online tasks and downtime</li>
<li>Eating well and staying hydrated</li>
<li>Maintaining healthy relationships and social connections</li>
<li>Varying your daily activities to avoid monotony</li>
</ul>
<p>For workplaces and learning environments, structured support like digital wellbeing check-ins, internal support tools, or even Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) can help participants reflect on their mental health and make small but important changes. No matter your role, prioritising your own wellbeing is key. And if you&rsquo;re in a position to influence others (e.g. designing a course, leading a team, or setting expectations), promoting self-care and digital balance can make a real difference for everyone involved.</p>

<p>For workplaces and learning environments, structured support like digital wellbeing check-ins, internal support tools, or even Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) can help participants reflect on their mental health and make small but important changes. No matter your role, prioritising your own wellbeing is key. And if you&rsquo;re in a position to influence others (e.g. designing a course, leading a team, or setting expectations), promoting self-care and digital balance can make a real difference for everyone involved.</p>
