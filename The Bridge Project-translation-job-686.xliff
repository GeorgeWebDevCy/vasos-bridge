&lt;p&gt;In the previous module we have discussed what the GDPR is and what its principles are. In this unit we will focus on specific words frequently used in GDPR context. As well as on the processes that come with the implementation of GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-1-Topic-1.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 1" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 1 - Consent and cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you enter a website for the first time you are often prompted to give consent to the processing of your data. What does this mean? Consent means that you agree to something. In this case the processing of your data by the website. Many websites ask this of you before you have even entered any data on the website. On one hand this is to be safe and on the other hand some websites start collecting data about your behaviour when you start using the website &amp;mdash; such as spending habits, interests, or from which country or region you are accessing the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another word you come across when going to a new website is &lt;strong&gt;cookies&lt;/strong&gt;. Unfortunately those are not delicious baked goods, but rather small files placed on your computer or phone when you visit a website. Cookies are used to &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; things about you or your device. Some are useful: they keep your chosen language on a site, remember the items in your shopping cart, or save your log-in so you do not need to type your password every time. Other cookies track your behaviour across websites &amp;mdash; for example, what you search for, which videos you watch, or which shops you visit online. This data can then be used to show you personalised adverts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why websites now often show a &amp;ldquo;cookie banner&amp;rdquo; where you can choose to accept or decline. GDPR requires that you give &lt;strong&gt;clear consent&lt;/strong&gt; before cookies that track your behaviour can be placed. Clicking &amp;ldquo;accept all&amp;rdquo; allows the website to use all cookies, but you usually also have the option to only accept the ones that are necessary. Learning to manage cookie settings is part of protecting your privacy online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-1-Topic-2.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 2 - Lawful basis, the right to object and the right to compensation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When organisations want to use your personal data, they need a good reason. Under GDPR these reasons are called &lt;strong&gt;lawful bases&lt;/strong&gt;. The most common one is consent, but there are others. For example, if you sign a work contract, your employer needs your data to pay you. That is called contractual necessity. Another basis is legal obligation, for example when authorities must keep tax or residency records. Sometimes organisations rely on legitimate interest, which means they have a reason that is not harmful to your rights, such as protecting against fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an individual you also have the right to object. This means you can say &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; if someone wants to use your data for certain purposes, especially for marketing. For example, you may receive emails advertising a service. You can object, and the organisation must stop sending them to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your data is misused and you suffer harm as a result, GDPR also gives you the right to compensation. This means you can claim damages in court if an organisation breaks the law and you are affected. Not everyone will need to use this right, but it is important to know it exists. Together, these rules make sure that data processing is not only legal, but also fair to you as the individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-1-Topic-3.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 3" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 3 - Controller, Processor&amp;nbsp;- Who is dealing with your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you share your personal data, there are usually two important roles: the &lt;strong&gt;controller&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;processor&lt;/strong&gt;. The controller is the one who decides why and how your data is used. For example, a school that collects student records is the controller. The processor is the one who carries out the instructions of the controller. In the same example, the school might use an IT company to manage its digital student database. That IT company is the processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? Because controllers have the main responsibility under GDPR. They must make sure data is collected lawfully, kept secure, and not misused. Processors also have duties: they cannot use the data for themselves and must only act on the controller&amp;rsquo;s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real-life example could be an online shop (controller) that hires a delivery company (processor) to ship orders. The shop decides which customer details are collected, like name and address, and the delivery company uses them only to deliver the package. If the delivery company wanted to use the addresses for its own advertising, that would break GDPR rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding these two roles helps you see who is responsible when your data is handled. It also shows why organisations often work together to provide services, and how GDPR makes sure your information is still protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-1-Topic-4.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 1 Topic 4" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 4 - Pseudonymisation, Tokenisation, Data Minimisation and Storage Limitation - What happens to your data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisations use different methods to protect your data and reduce risks. One is &lt;strong&gt;pseudonymisation&lt;/strong&gt;. This means replacing names or details with codes, so that a person cannot be identified unless there is extra information. For example, a research study might replace participant names with numbers. The list that matches numbers to names is stored separately and securely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A similar word is &lt;strong&gt;tokenisation&lt;/strong&gt;. This is often used in banking or online payments. Your real credit card number is replaced with a token &amp;mdash; a random code &amp;mdash; so the website never stores your actual card number. This way, even if the token is stolen, it cannot be used outside that system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data minimisation&lt;/strong&gt; is another principle. It means collecting only what is necessary. For example, if you sign up for a newsletter, the website should not ask for your full home address. An email address is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;storage limitation&lt;/strong&gt; refers to how long data is kept. Organisations are not allowed to keep your data forever &amp;ldquo;just in case.&amp;rdquo; Once it is no longer needed for the original purpose, it must be deleted. For example, a job applicant&amp;rsquo;s data should be erased after the hiring process is complete, unless there is consent to keep it longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together these practices reduce risks, protect your privacy, and limit damage if something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
