<p>A data breach occurs when private information is accessed or shared without permission: sometimes through hacking, sometimes by simple mistake.</p>
<p>The consequences can be immediate, such as stolen passwords or locked accounts, but they can also stretch into the future, with risks like identity theft, financial loss, or broken trust. For migrant women in education, the stakes are high when documents like residency papers or school records are involved. In this unit, we&rsquo;ll clarify what qualifies as a data breach, how to recognise the warning signs, and the right steps to take to limit the damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Constitutes a Data Breach?</h2>
<p><strong>A data breach</strong> sounds like something from a Hollywood movie: hooded men, green code running down the screen, and dramatic music. In reality? It&rsquo;s often far less glamorous. A breach is simply when information that&rsquo;s supposed to be private ends up somewhere it shouldn&rsquo;t. Sometimes it&rsquo;s because a hacker has smashed their way in; other times, it&rsquo;s because someone left a laptop on a bus...<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="3.2 Unit 2 Data Breaches Recognition and Response" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/3.2-Unit-2-Data-Breaches-Recognition-and-Response.webp" alt="3.2 Unit 2 Data Breaches Recognition and Response" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p><br>There are several types of&nbsp;<strong>breaches.</strong> One of the most common is <span style="color: #007c3d">hacking</span>, where criminals deliberately break into systems to steal or block information. In 2020, for example, several European universities had their research locked by ransomware until payments were made. But breaches don&rsquo;t always come from skilled attackers: sometimes they happen through simple mistakes. An email with sensitive attachments sent to the wrong person is still a breach, even if no one intended harm.</p>
<p>Next up: <span style="color: #007c3d"><strong>personal vs. institutional data</strong>.</span> <strong>Personal data</strong> is the stuff that makes you, you: residency papers, ID numbers, bank accounts. For migrant women, this is the kind of information scammers would love to get their hands on. <strong>Institutional data</strong> belongs to organisations: budgets, staff files, exam papers. Lose either, and the fallout can range from &ldquo;mildly embarrassing&rdquo; to &ldquo;career-ending disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then we&rsquo;ve got&nbsp;<span style="color: #007c3d"><strong>intentional vs. accidental breaches</strong>.</span> Intentional means someone did it on purpose, like an angry employee leaking files. Accidental means, well, someone messed up. Both can be equally catastrophic, though one comes with a villain and the other with an apology email.<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="3.2 Unit 2 - What Constitutes a Data Breach" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/3.2-Unit-2-What-Constitutes-a-Data-Breach-1.webp" alt="3.2 Unit 2 - What Constitutes a Data Breach" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p><br>And finally, scale matters. If one person&rsquo;s Netflix password leaks, that&rsquo;s annoying. If millions of residency numbers or student records are exposed, that&rsquo;s a crisis. The key questions are: What was taken? Who has it? And how could they use it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: a data breach isn&rsquo;t just an IT problem. It&rsquo;s a real-life mess that can hit your pocket, your<br>future, and your peace of mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Early Warning Signs of Data Breaches</h2>
<p>Spotting a data breach early is like noticing smoke before a fire. If you act quickly, you can stop the damage from spreading. The problem is, as previously mentioned, the warning signs don&rsquo;t come with a big flashing siren. They&rsquo;re often subtle, and easy to dismiss. Let&rsquo;s look at the key ones.<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="3.2 Unit 2 Early Warning Signs of Data Breaches" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/3.2-Unit-2-Early-Warning-Signs-of-Data-Breaches.webp" alt="3.2 Unit 2 Early Warning Signs of Data Breaches" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Unusual Account Activity<strong><br></strong></h3>
Imagine you log into your learning portal and half the lessons are marked as &ldquo;completed&rdquo;, but you never opened them. Or worse, you see messages sent from your account that you didn&rsquo;t write. That&rsquo;s a clear sign someone else is inside your account. It&rsquo;s the digital version of walking into your kitchen and finding someone else making tea. Strange, unsettling, and definitely not normal.
<p>Or another example: you get a message from a friend asking you to click a link and vote for their &ldquo;niece&rdquo; in a children&rsquo;s poetry contest. The message even includes the child&rsquo;s name and picture. You click, you vote, and you feel proud for helping out. And then, (oh, the horror) you discover that everyone in your contact list, old school friends, teachers, mother of your ex, people you&rsquo;ve made a special effort to ignore - have just received the exact same message, but this time from your account. Your good name is tarnished, and you feel like an absolute idiot. True story from the author of this module! ;)<br><br></p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Unexpected password reset emails<strong><br></strong></h3>
A classic red flag is receiving password reset emails you never asked for. For migrant women juggling multiple platforms, school portals, language apps, immigration services, it&rsquo;s easy to think, &ldquo;Maybe I clicked something by accident.&rdquo; But here&rsquo;s the truth: if you didn&rsquo;t request a reset, someone else probably did. It&rsquo;s like the doorbell ringing at 3am. You didn&rsquo;t order takeaway, so who, exactly, is standing outside?</li>
<li>
<h3>Slow system performance<strong><br></strong></h3>
Computers slow down for many reasons: too many browser tabs, old hardware, or that one cousin who installed 12 &ldquo;free&rdquo; toolbars. But if your system suddenly becomes sluggish for no reason, malware could be running in the background, chewing through your resources.<br><br></li>
<li>
<h3>Unknown devices in account settings<strong><br></strong></h3>
Most platforms let you check where your account is logged in. If you&rsquo;re in Berlin but your account shows active sessions in Madrid and Istanbul, something is wrong. For women balancing family, study, and work across borders, this check is crucial. Unless you&rsquo;ve secretly developed the ability to teleport, log those strangers out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><br>Notifications from services you don&rsquo;t recognise</strong><br>Getting emails that your account has been accessed from platforms you&rsquo;ve never joined is another warning. Migrant women sometimes sign up for community services or online groups, but if a name looks odd or unfamiliar, don&rsquo;t assume it&rsquo;s legit.<br><br></p>
