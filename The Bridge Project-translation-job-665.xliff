<p>To illustrate how the GDPR protects the data of European residents, we will explore four cases where&nbsp;DPAs have made use of their tools to deal with the danger of data breaches and to hold those&nbsp;accountable who have caused it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-4-Topic-1.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 1" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>Topic 1 - Hospital Patient Mix-Up in Germany</h2>
<p>In Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, a hospital was fined &euro;105,000 after a patient admission error led to the mixing up of patient files and the issuing of incorrect invoices. The supervisory authority&rsquo;s investigation revealed significant deficiencies in both technical and organizational safeguards for handling sensitive health data, resulting in a breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Health data falls under the category of special category data as defined by Article 9 GDPR, requiring heightened protection due to its sensitive nature. The hospital failed to implement adequate measures to ensure compliance with several core GDPR principles outlined in Article 5:</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy (Article 5(1)(d)):</strong> Patient files were incorrectly assigned, leading to inaccurate medical and administrative records. GDPR obliges controllers to maintain personal data that is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The failure to prevent mix-ups directly violated this principle.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)):</strong> By not preventing unauthorized access to or alteration of patient data, the hospital failed to safeguard confidentiality. Patients&rsquo; health and billing data were exposed to misuse through inadequate protection.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability (Article 5(2)):</strong> The hospital was unable to demonstrate effective internal processes and safeguards ensuring data protection. This lack of organizational responsibility contravened the GDPR&rsquo;s accountability principle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>Article 32 (security of processing)</strong> requires controllers to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure data. The investigation found the hospital&rsquo;s safeguards insufficient, indicating both management and system-level weaknesses. The fine of &euro;105,000 underscores the regulatory expectation that health institutions must handle personal and medical data with the highest standards of accuracy, confidentiality, and accountability. This case illustrates that failures in data management, even when accidental, can constitute serious violations under GDPR.</p>

<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-4-Topic-2.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 2" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>Topic 2 - Cookie Banner &amp; Pre-Ticked Checkboxes</h2>
<p>In the landmark Planet49 case, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled against the use of pre-ticked checkboxes for cookie consent. The German company Planet49 had designed an online lottery registration form where participants were presented with a pre-selected option authorizing the use of advertising cookies. Users were deemed to have &ldquo;consented&rdquo; unless they actively deselected the checkbox. In addition, the information provided to users about the duration of cookies and the identity of third parties accessing them was vague and incomplete.</p>
<p>The CJEU held that this practice violated the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, as it failed to meet the requirements for valid consent under Article 4(11) GDPR. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous. Pre-ticked boxes do not involve an active choice and therefore cannot constitute valid consent.</p>
<p>Several GDPR principles under Article 5 were implicated:</p>
<p><strong>Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency (Article 5(1)(a)):</strong> The hospital&rsquo;s (company&rsquo;s) reliance on implied consent through pre-ticked boxes was neither transparent nor fair, as users were not fully informed about how their data would be processed.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose Limitation and Data Minimization (Articles 5(1)(b) and (c)):</strong> The use of cookies for advertising required clear and specific consent. Automatically applying broad cookie tracking without explicit approval exceeded what was necessary or justified.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability (Article 5(2)):</strong> The company could not demonstrate that it had obtained valid, explicit consent in accordance with GDPR standards.</p>
<p>The ruling confirmed that organizations must implement clear, active opt-in mechanisms for cookies and provide full information about their use, duration, and third-party access. This case set a critical precedent in EU data protection law, emphasizing that cookie consent must always be explicit and informed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-4-Topic-3.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 4 Topic 3" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>Topic 3 - Polish Hospital Failure to Notify a Data Breach</h2>
<p>A county hospital in Września, Poland, was fined &euro;6,800 after failing to notify both the supervisory authority and the affected individuals of a personal data breach within the required timeframe. The Polish data protection authority determined that this omission constituted a clear violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Under GDPR, personal data breaches must be handled with transparency and urgency to protect individuals&rsquo; rights and freedoms. Specifically, <strong>Article 33</strong> requires controllers to notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach, unless the incident is unlikely to result in risk. In addition, <strong>Article 34</strong> obliges controllers to inform the affected data subjects directly and without undue delay if the breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>In this case, the hospital failed to fulfill both obligations. The lack of timely communication left patients unaware of the potential exposure of their personal data and unable to take protective measures, such as monitoring for misuse or fraud. This failure undermined the principle of <strong>transparency (Article 5(1)(a))</strong>, as individuals were denied clear and prompt information about what happened to their data.</p>
<p>The incident also reflects a breach of the GDPR&rsquo;s <strong>accountability principle (Article 5(2))</strong>, since the hospital could not demonstrate that it had appropriate procedures in place to detect, assess, and respond to data breaches in compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>The relatively modest fine of &euro;6,800 reflects the scale of the incident but reinforces an important lesson: even smaller institutions must implement effective incident response processes. Timely breach notifications are not optional but a legal obligation designed to protect individuals from harm.</p>

<h2>Topic 4 - Major Hospital in the Netherlands &amp; Staff &ldquo;Snooping&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A hospital in The Hague, Netherlands, was fined &euro;460,000 after staff members were found accessing the medical records of a well-known patient without legitimate professional need. The Dutch Data Protection Authority concluded that the hospital failed to implement sufficient safeguards to protect highly sensitive health data, constituting a serious breach of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Health data is classified as special category data under Article 9 GDPR and requires particularly strict safeguards. In this case, the hospital did not adequately restrict or monitor access to patient records, enabling unauthorized staff members to view confidential information. This failure violated several fundamental GDPR principles outlined in Article 5:</p>
<p><strong>Integrity and Confidentiality (Article 5(1)(f)):</strong> The hospital did not ensure that health records were protected against unauthorized access. Sensitive data was exposed to internal misuse, undermining patient trust.</p>
<p><strong>Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation (Articles 5(1)(b) and 5(1)(c)):</strong> Access to medical records should be limited strictly to what is necessary for patient care. By allowing staff to browse records without necessity, the hospital breached these principles.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability (Article 5(2)):</strong> The hospital failed to demonstrate that it had effective internal controls, such as strict access rights management or systematic auditing, to safeguard personal data as required under GDPR.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Article 32 (security of processing)</strong> obliges organizations to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data. The hospital&rsquo;s weak access controls and insufficient monitoring mechanisms fell short of this standard.</p>
<p>The &euro;460,000 fine reflects both the sensitivity of the compromised data and the hospital&rsquo;s responsibility to prevent such &ldquo;snooping&rdquo; incidents. This case highlights the importance of strong access restrictions, regular audits, and effective staff awareness measures to protect patient confidentiality under GDPR.</p>
