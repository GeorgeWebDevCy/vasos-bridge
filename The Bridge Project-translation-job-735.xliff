Online learning has made education more flexible and accessible. You can study from home, join language classes, or learn job skills at your own pace. But while online courses are helpful, they can also pose risks. Some websites or platforms are fake, unsafe, or poorly managed. Others collect too much of your personal data or have weak security. If you are not careful, your information could be stolen or misused.

This unit will help you understand the most common risks in online education—and how to avoid them. You will learn how to choose safe platforms, protect your accounts, and adjust your privacy settings.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - Is this course real or risky? How to spot fake or unsafe online learning platforms</h2>
There are so many <span style="text-decoration: underline;">online courses</span> available - you can learn a new language or earn a job certification. While many platforms are reliable, some are scams or poorly built, and they do not protect your personal data. These sites may ask for private details like your ID number or bank information, then misuse or sell your data. Others may be legitimate but offer low-quality education or issue fake diplomas.
<h3>Red flags to watch for:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>No clear information about who teaches the course</li>
 	<li>No privacy policy or contact information</li>
 	<li>Requests for too much personal data before showing course content</li>
 	<li>Fake-looking websites with spelling errors, pop-ups, or intrusive ads</li>
 	<li>Unrealistic promises (“Get a diploma in 2 days!”)</li>
</ul>
Platforms that do NOT follow basic security rules—such as HTTPS encryption (means the website you visit keeps your information private) or access controls—can expose your personal data to others, even within the platform itself.
<h3>How to recognize a safe platform:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Uses secure URLs (starts with “https://” and shows a lock icon)</li>
 	<li>Clearly shows who provides the course (e.g., a university or NGO)</li>
 	<li>Offers contact information and support</li>
 	<li>Has a clear data protection or privacy policy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Before enrolling in a course, ask yourself:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Was it recommended by someone you trust, or did you find it randomly?</li>
 	<li>Does it have reviews or references from real users?</li>
 	<li>Is the platform linked to a school, employer, or community organization?</li>
</ul>
Choosing the right course is the first step. In the next topic, we will talk about how to protect your login details when you sign up.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 2 - Passwords and login safety – How to secure your learning accounts</h2>
Some risks in online learning do not come from the course itself—but from how you log in. If you reuse the same password across multiple sites, and one gets hacked, all your accounts are at risk. This is known as <strong>credential stuffing</strong>: attackers use stolen passwords from one site (like Facebook) to break into others (like your email or learning portal).
<h3>Common login risks:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Using weak passwords (like “123456”, your name, or your birthday)</li>
 	<li>Reusing the same password on different sites</li>
 	<li>Logging in through fake “Google” or “Facebook” pop-ups</li>
 	<li>Not enabling two-factor authentication (2FA)</li>
</ul>
Some fake courses are designed just to steal your login details. They may show a screen that looks like Google or Facebook but actually sends your credentials to scammers.
<h4></h4>
<h3>Safe habits for protecting your account:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Use a unique password for each important account</li>
 	<li>Combine letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
 	<li>Example: l3arnSafe2025!</li>
 	<li>Enable two-factor authentication when possible</li>
 	<li>Avoid logging in with social media unless you fully trust the platform</li>
</ul>
You can check if your email or password has been exposed in a data breach at: <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://haveibeenpwned.com/</a>

According to cybersecurity experts, platforms without strong login protections—or limits on failed login attempts—are more vulnerable to attacks. That means you should be cautious about which platforms you trust with your personal accounts.
<h4></h4>
<h3>How to safely store your passwords:</h3>
It is normal to forget passwords, especially if you use a different one for each site (which is safer!). To avoid forgetting them:
<ul>
 	<li>Use a password manager. This is an app that safely stores all your passwords and can even generate strong ones for you.</li>
 	<li>If you write passwords down, keep them in a secure place (not on a sticky note by your computer!).</li>
 	<li>Avoid storing passwords in plain text on your phone or computer where others can see them.</li>
</ul>
<h4></h4>
<h3>How often to change passwords:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Change important account passwords every 3–6 months or immediately if you hear about a data breach.</li>
 	<li>For less important accounts, you can change them less often, but never reuse passwords across multiple sites.</li>
</ul>
In the next topic, we will explore privacy settings on learning platforms—and why it matters who can see your information.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 3 - Your digital classroom – who can see your information?</h2>
<strong>Online courses</strong> often ask for your personal information—such as your name, email address, and other details. But it is not just about that:
<ul>
 	<li>They may track your learning behavior (how fast you read, your performance, and when you log in)</li>
 	<li>Record video calls or forum replies</li>
 	<li>Allow other learners or teachers to see your full name, email, or discussion posts</li>
</ul>
Sometimes, there are no clear privacy settings—or the platform does not tell you who can access your data.
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Strangers or other users may be able to see your personal information (name, email, etc.)</li>
 	<li>Videos may be recorded without your knowledge</li>
 	<li>Platforms may lack audit controls, so you cannot tell who accessed your data or when</li>
</ul>
This makes it harder to know if your information is being shared or misused.
<h3>How to protect your learning privacy:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Use a nickname or just your first name in forums and class discussions</li>
 	<li>Turn off your camera and mute your microphone when not needed</li>
 	<li>Use a virtual or blurred background during video calls</li>
 	<li>Adjust privacy settings to hide your email or make your profile private</li>
 	<li>Avoid sharing personal details (like your location, children’s names, or phone number) in discussions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Before joining a course, check if the platform:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Offers privacy settings</li>
 	<li>Makes video recordings optional</li>
 	<li>Let’s you control who can see your profile and activity</li>
</ul>
In online courses, you should feel just as safe as you would in a real classroom.
