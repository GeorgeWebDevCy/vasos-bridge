Actions of European Enterprises</h2>
<p>As digitalisation accelerates, companies across Europe are becoming increasingly aware of their environmental responsibilities. The data shows that sustainability is no longer an optional extra&mdash;it&rsquo;s becoming a strategic business imperative.</p>
<p>In 2022, around 58.5% of EU enterprises reported that they consider the environmental impact when selecting ICT services or equipment. This reflects a growing commitment to responsible procurement, where digital tools are chosen not just for performance but also for their ecological footprint (eurostat, n.d.).</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.5-Unit-5-Taking-Action-for-Digital-Sustainability-1.webp" alt="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 1" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>The figure above illustrates how this awareness varies among EU countries. Southern European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Cyprus lead the way, with more than 70% of companies factoring environmental impact into their ICT choices. Beyond purchasing decisions, companies are also acting internally: 66% of enterprises implemented measures to reduce paper consumption, and nearly one-third (28.3%) reported reselling, donating, or returning unused ICT equipment&mdash;a promising step toward circular economy practices (eurostat, n.d.).</p>
<p><strong>As shown in the following figure, sustainability practices now extend to ICT disposal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>77.4% of EU enterprises recycle or dispose of old ICT equipment through official e-waste channels.<br><br></li>
<li>49.5% keep unused devices in storage.<br><br></li>
<li>28.3% choose to sell, donate, or return ICT equipment to leasing providers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, larger enterprises are 26 percentage points more likely than smaller ones to engage in these circular practices, highlighting how resources and awareness shape environmental action. Together, these figures show that sustainability strategies are expanding beyond isolated &ldquo;green&rdquo; initiatives. Businesses are beginning to approach digital sustainability holistically &mdash; from acquisition and usage to responsible end-of-life management &mdash; building the foundation for a more circular, resource-efficient digital economy (eurostat, n.d.).</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.5-Unit-5-Taking-Action-for-Digital-Sustainability-2.webp" alt="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 2" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>5.2 Company Strategies and Environmental Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Environmental responsibility is no longer a &ldquo;nice to have&rdquo; &mdash; it&rsquo;s a strategic imperative that defines how businesses operate, innovate, and sustain long-term growth. According to the World Economic Forum (2020), sustainability is not limited to green companies; it must be embedded into every corporate strategy. Organisations can advance by fostering public&ndash;private collaborations, sourcing responsibly, innovating across product life cycles, and ensuring transparency in their operations (World Economic Forum, 2020).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Adapting to New Environmental Trends</h3>
<p>As global concern for the environment grows, companies are aligning their strategies with emerging sustainability trends. These include adopting sustainable operations, creating eco-friendly products and services, and committing to corporate social and environmental responsibility. Businesses are increasingly aware that integrating sustainability improves their reputation, drives innovation, and meets consumer expectations for ethical practices. Partnerships and multi-sector cooperation are essential to tackle complex challenges like climate change and resource scarcity.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Incorporating Sustainability into Operations</h3>
<p>Operational efficiency is central to sustainability. Companies can reduce their footprint by cutting energy and water use, implementing recycling programs, and switching to renewable energy sources. Sustainable supply chain management&mdash;collaborating with suppliers who share sustainable values&mdash;further enhances long-term resilience. As McKinsey (2020) highlights, optimising operations can deliver both environmental and financial benefits (Mueller et al., 2020).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Linear vs. Circular Economies</h3>
<p>A sustainable future demands a shift from a linear economy&mdash;based on the &ldquo;take, make, use, dispose&rdquo; model&mdash;to a circular economy, which designs out waste and maximises resource efficiency. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation defines the circular economy as a regenerative system that keeps materials in use for as long as possible through repair, remanufacturing, and recycling. This approach moves beyond single-use consumption and encourages companies to view resources as renewable loops rather than finite assets (Ellen MacArthur Foundation, n.d.).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Circular Principles in Hybrid Work</h3>
<p>In the hybrid work context, circular thinking is already emerging. The flexible office and co-working sector demonstrates this principle through shared-use models. Spaces and resources are designed for durability and shared among many users, reducing waste and maximising efficiency. For example, rotating workstations or shared office setups allow 150 employees to use the same 50 desks&mdash;an embodiment of the circular mindset.</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.5-Unit-5-Taking-Action-for-Digital-Sustainability-3.webp" alt="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 3" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2><br>5.3 Employee Involvement and Empowerment in Sustainability</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s climate-conscious world, empowering employees to be active participants in sustainability efforts is not just ethical&mdash;it&rsquo;s essential. Employees are the heart of any organization, and their engagement in environmental initiatives can significantly amplify impact, foster innovation, and drive a culture of responsibility.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Leading by Example: Top-Down Sustainability</h3>
<p>Sustainable change starts at the top. Leadership plays a pivotal role in signaling the importance of environmental responsibility. A 2022 Forbes article underscores that small actions&mdash;like choosing public transport, using reusable materials, or even talking about green habits&mdash;can have a ripple effect. Leaders who are vocal and visible in their sustainable choices encourage employees to follow suit. Incorporating sustainability into the company&rsquo;s brand identity and values ensures that it becomes part of the organizational DNA, not just a checklist (Laker, 2022).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Digital-First, Eco-Friendly: Green Communication Tools</h3>
<p>The shift to hybrid and remote work environments opens up new opportunities to minimize environmental impact. Tools like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet eliminate the need for travel, reducing carbon footprints while maintaining productivity. Cloud-based collaboration platforms such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive reduce the need for printed documents, supporting paperless workflows. Meanwhile, project management software like Trello, Asana, and Jira empowers teams to coordinate effectively without the need for in-person meetings (Tafradzhiyski, 2025).</p>
<p>Encouraging the use of these tools is a practical step with lasting environmental benefits. Organizations can go further by training employees on how to use them efficiently and selecting platforms based on energy performance and low server emissions (O&rsquo;Toole et al., 2020).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Incentivize Sustainable Commuting</h3>
<p>Green commuting programs are especially relevant in hybrid contexts. Employers can offer incentives for sustainable travel methods such as cycling, carpooling, or using public transit. Installing bike racks, offering shower facilities, and securing discounts on bike-sharing schemes make eco-friendly commuting more accessible. A suggestion from a LinkedIn contributor even proposed gamifying commuting&mdash;awarding points or rewards for employees who consistently choose sustainable transportation. Such initiatives create a fun, competitive spirit while fostering meaningful behavior change (Tafradzhiyski, 2025).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Empower Through Participation: Sustainability Committees</h3>
<p>Creating a sustainability committee is a powerful way to turn employee interest into action. These groups serve as internal champions who brainstorm, plan, and lead eco-initiatives aligned with the organization&rsquo;s mission. According to NC State University, such committees greatly increase the success rate of sustainability goals, especially in remote environments where face-to-face influence is limited. Encouraging participation in external sustainability challenges&mdash;like Plastic Free July&mdash;can also drive engagement. These initiatives not only raise awareness but also bring teams together around a common goal, creating shared momentum and boosting morale (Mesthill, 2021).</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Showcase and Celebrate Success</h3>
<p>Recognizing and sharing sustainability successes is just as important as initiating them. Promoting these efforts via internal newsletters, social media, and the company website keeps sustainability visible and valued. Featuring employee testimonials, spotlighting eco-friendly actions, or sharing &ldquo;green wins&rdquo; reinforces the message that every contribution matters. Companies like Meta have dedicated entire websites to their sustainability efforts, demonstrating how transparency can strengthen reputation and attract environmentally-conscious talent.</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.5-Unit-5-Taking-Action-for-Digital-Sustainability-4.webp" alt="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 4" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><br>5.4 Sustainability Communication and Stakeholder Engagement</h2>
<p>Sustainability communication and stakeholder engagement are critical pillars for any organization aiming to lead with purpose and integrity. They go beyond slogans and CSR reports&mdash;these efforts foster transparency, trust, and collaborative impact among employees, customers, partners, and the wider community.</p>
<h3>Why Is Sustainability Communication So Difficult?</h3>
<p>Despite growing interest in sustainability, communicating it effectively remains a challenge. The reasons are complex (World Economic Forum, 2022):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mistrust</strong> &mdash; Many stakeholders suspect sustainability messaging is simply performative. When companies communicate just to tick boxes, audiences perceive it as greenwashing.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Widespread misinformation</strong> &mdash; Sustainability entered mainstream discourse rapidly, leading to confusion. Overexposure and vague definitions contribute to skepticism and misunderstanding.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>It demands change</strong> &mdash; Sustainability often calls for shifts in behavior or thinking. That&rsquo;s a hard sell when benefits are long-term and not immediately visible.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Science isn&rsquo;t always engaging</strong> &mdash; Sustainability is evidence-based, but scientific messaging can feel dry, complicated, or inaccessible to non-experts.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Positive impact is hard to measure</strong> &mdash; It&rsquo;s easier to spot failures than successes. Communicating honest but imperfect progress can be uncomfortable, yet it&rsquo;s necessary for credibility.<br><br></li>
</ol>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 5" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.5-Unit-5-Taking-Action-for-Digital-Sustainability-5.webp" alt="5.5 Unit 5 - Taking Action for Digital Sustainability 5" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><br>7 Ways to Communicate Sustainability Effectively</h3>
<p>Organizations can overcome these barriers with a thoughtful, multi-faceted communication strategy (World Economic Forum, 2022):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Share measurable, honest data on emissions, energy use, waste reduction, and progress toward sustainability goals. Open reporting builds long-term trust.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Internal Communication:</strong> Engage employees through training, updates, intranet news, newsletters, and town halls. When staff understand and contribute to green goals, change becomes cultural.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>External Communication:</strong> Use websites, social media, press releases, and sustainability reports to keep the public and stakeholders informed.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Partnerships and Collaboration:</strong> Work with NGOs, government bodies, and industry peers to scale impact. Collaboration also signals authenticity and shared responsibility.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Certifications and Awards:</strong> Third-party certifications (like B Corp, ISO 14001) validate efforts and increase stakeholder confidence.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> Dialogue is key. Involve stakeholders in shaping policies and gathering feedback through consultations, surveys, or focus groups.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Storytelling and Visualization:</strong> Numbers matter, but stories resonate. Use employee experiences, community case studies, and infographics to make your sustainability journey relatable and inspiring.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>Science isn&rsquo;t always engaging</strong> &mdash; Sustainability is evidence-based, but scientific messaging can feel dry, complicated, or inaccessible to non-experts.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Positive impact is hard to measure</strong> &mdash; It&rsquo;s easier to spot failures than successes. Communicating honest but imperfect progress can be uncomfortable, yet it&rsquo;s necessary for credibility.<br><br></li>

<h3><br>7 Ways to Communicate Sustainability Effectively</h3>
<p>Organizations can overcome these barriers with a thoughtful, multi-faceted communication strategy (World Economic Forum, 2022):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Share measurable, honest data on emissions, energy use, waste reduction, and progress toward sustainability goals. Open reporting builds long-term trust.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Internal Communication:</strong> Engage employees through training, updates, intranet news, newsletters, and town halls. When staff understand and contribute to green goals, change becomes cultural.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>External Communication:</strong> Use websites, social media, press releases, and sustainability reports to keep the public and stakeholders informed.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Partnerships and Collaboration:</strong> Work with NGOs, government bodies, and industry peers to scale impact. Collaboration also signals authenticity and shared responsibility.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Certifications and Awards:</strong> Third-party certifications (like B Corp, ISO 14001) validate efforts and increase stakeholder confidence.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> Dialogue is key. Involve stakeholders in shaping policies and gathering feedback through consultations, surveys, or focus groups.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Storytelling and Visualization:</strong> Numbers matter, but stories resonate. Use employee experiences, community case studies, and infographics to make your sustainability journey relatable and inspiring.</li>
