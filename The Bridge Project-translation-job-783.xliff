Your personal data is collected by many different organisations – private companies, public institutions, or non-profit groups. This can happen when you use a website, apply for services, or even walk past a security camera. Each of these organisations has a reason for collecting your data, and it’s important to know what those reasons are. In this unit, you will learn who is responsible for your data, what roles they play, and how to recognise when data is being collected. This knowledge will help you ask the right questions and better protect your privacy.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - Who Collects Your Data?</h2>
Every day, your personal data is collected by different organisations. This can happen online or in real life, often without you even noticing. The people or organisations that collect your data can be companies, public institutions like schools or hospitals, and also non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

For example, when you sign up for a social media account, the platform collects your name, email address, and maybe even your location. A public hospital collects your health data to provide you with care. An NGO helping migrants might ask for your phone number to stay in touch or to support your application for services.

It is important to know who is collecting your data and why. Each organisation has to follow rules and must inform you clearly about what kind of data they are collecting and what they will use it for. In legal terms, the person or group that decides why and how your data is collected is called a <strong>data controller</strong>. They are responsible for keeping your data safe and using it legally.

Understanding this helps you make better decisions about what information to share and with whom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If something doesn’t feel right, you have the right to ask questions and even refuse to give certain data, unless it is strictly necessary.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="7.2 Unit 2 - Who Handles Your Data and How" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.2-Unit-2-Who-Handles-Your-Data-and-How.webp" alt="7.2 Unit 2 - Who Handles Your Data and How" width="auto" height="auto" /></span>
<h2>Topic 2 - What is a Data Controller vs. Data Processor?</h2>
When someone collects your personal data, they usually play one of two roles — either a <strong>data controller</strong> or a <strong>data processor</strong>. These terms sound technical, but understanding the difference helps you know who is responsible for your data.

A <strong>data controller</strong> is the person, company or organisation that decides why your personal data is being collected and how it will be used. For example, if a language school signs you up for a course and asks for your contact details, they decide how that data is stored and used — they are the controller.

A <strong>data processor</strong> is someone who only handles your data on behalf of the controller. They follow instructions but don’t make their own decisions about the data. For instance, if the language school uses a company to send email reminders to students, that company is a processor. They work with the data, but only under the school’s control.

In most situations, only the controller communicates with you and is responsible for informing you about your rights and protecting your data. But processors also have legal obligations, especially to keep data secure and report problems if something goes wrong.

As a <strong>data subject</strong>, it’s important to know that the controller is your main point of contact when you have questions, want to access your data, or want to make a complaint. Recognising these roles can help you understand who is responsible and where to turn if your data is misused.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 3 - Why Organisations Collect Personal Data and What They Use it for</h2>
Organisations collect personal data for many different reasons. Some of them are required by law, others help the organisation provide better services or improve their communication with you. It is important to know why your data is being collected and whether the reason is valid.

For example, a public office might ask for your name, birthdate and address to process your application for social benefits. A doctor collects health information to give you proper treatment. A charity working with migrant women might ask about your language skills or number of children to offer the right support. These are all valid reasons if the data is used fairly and kept safe.

Sometimes, companies collect your data for marketing or statistics. For example, a shop may ask for your email to send discount offers or a website may collect your preferences to show you relevant ads. In these cases, you must be clearly informed and usually have the option to say no.

An organisation should always explain what kind of data they collect, why they need it, and how long they will keep it. If they want to use your data for something else later, they must tell you and often ask for new consent.

Understanding these reasons gives you more control. When you know why your data is needed, you can better decide if you want to share it. If the purpose is not clear or seems unnecessary, you have the right to ask questions or refuse to give your data unless it is legally required.

&nbsp;
<h2>Gamification Activity</h2>
<h3>Activity Title: Who Is Collecting My Data?</h3>
Read the short scenario and answer three questions about it. Each question has three possible answers - choose the one that is correct.

<strong>Scenario</strong>
An NGO organises a free course about digital skills for migrant women. During the course, they take some photos and short videos with permission from the participants. Later, the NGO saves these files on a website called SafeStore, which is used only for storage.
