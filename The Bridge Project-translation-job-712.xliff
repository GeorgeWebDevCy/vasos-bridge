Under the GDPR, you have the right to ask an organisation to correct any personal data they have about you if it is wrong or incomplete. This is called the <strong>Right to Rectification</strong>. You also have the <strong>Right to Erasure</strong>, sometimes called the “<strong>Right to be Forgotten</strong>.” This means you can ask an organisation to delete your personal data in certain situations. These rights help you keep your information accurate and safe.

In this unit, you will learn how and when you can use these rights to protect your personal data.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - Right to rectification</h2>
<strong>The Right to Rectification</strong> is an important right under <strong>Article 16</strong> of the GDPR. It allows you to ask an organisation to correct or complete your personal data if it is wrong, incomplete, or out of date.

Organisations must fix the issue quickly—usually within one month. If they have shared your data with other companies, they may also need to inform them so they can correct it too.

<strong>You can ask for rectification in situations such as:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Your address or phone number is incorrect — you can ask them to update it.</li>
 	<li>Information is incomplete — for example, you can ask them to add your new home address or an updated emergency contact.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>
However, not everything can be changed.</em></strong> If the data is someone else’s opinion or judgement (like a note that says “<em>she is not a team player</em>”), this is not a fact and may not be corrected. But you can ask them to add a note saying that you disagree with it.

This right is important because incorrect data can cause problems. For example, if your bank has the wrong phone number, they may not be able to contact you in an emergency.

You do not need to explain why you want your data corrected—just clearly say what is wrong and what the correct information is.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 2 - Right to Erasure</h2>
<strong>The Right to Erasure</strong>, also known as the “<strong>Right to Be Forgotten</strong>,” is explained in <strong>Article 17</strong> of the GDPR. This right allows you to ask an organisation to delete your personal data—but only in specific situations.
<h3><strong>
</strong>When can you ask for your data to be erased?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The data is no longer needed for the purpose it was originally collected.</li>
 	<li>You withdraw your consent, and there is no other legal reason for the organisation to keep your data.</li>
 	<li>The data was processed unlawfully.</li>
 	<li>The data must be erased to follow a legal obligation, such as a court order.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Important: This is not an absolute right.</span>
<h3><strong>
</strong>Organisations can refuse to delete your data if they need it for:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Freedom of expression (e.g. journalism)</li>
 	<li>Legal obligations (e.g. tax or employment law)</li>
 	<li>Public interest or official authority</li>
 	<li>Public health or research purposes</li>
 	<li>Defending legal claims</li>
</ul>
If your data has already been shared with others, especially online or publicly, the organisation should take reasonable steps to ask those others to delete copies or remove links to your data.
<h3><strong>
</strong>As with other GDPR rights:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>The organisation must respond within one month.</li>
 	<li>The request is free of charge.</li>
 	<li>If they refuse to delete your data, they must explain why.</li>
</ul>
<strong>
Example:</strong>

If you cancel your gym membership, you can ask the gym to delete your personal data and health notes. If they have shared this data with someone else (such as a fitness partner or online platform), they should ask those parties to delete it as well.
