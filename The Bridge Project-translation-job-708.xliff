In this unit, you will learn about two important rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): the <strong>Right to Restriction of Processing</strong> and the <strong>Right to Data Portability</strong>. These rights give you more control over how your personal data is used. The Right to Restriction of Processing means you can ask an organisation to stop using your data in certain situations, such as when the data is incorrect or when you object to the processing. The Right to Data Portability allows you to receive your personal data in a usable format and transfer it to another service or organisation. This unit will help you understand what these rights mean, when you can use them, and how they protect your personal information in real life.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - Right to Restriction of Processing</h2>
This right is found in <strong>Article 18</strong> of the GDPR. It allows you to ask any organisation to pause the use of your personal data. This doesn’t mean they have to delete your data, but they must stop using it for a certain period.

<strong>You can request this right in the following situations:</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>You believe the data is incorrect — you can ask them to stop using it until it is corrected.</li>
 	<li>You believe the data is being used unlawfully — you don’t want it deleted immediately, but you want them to stop using it.</li>
 	<li>You have objected to the use of your data — and the organisation is still reviewing your objection.</li>
</ol>
While your data is restricted, the organisation can still store it, but they cannot use it to make decisions, share it with others, or use it for marketing or profiling.

<strong>Example:</strong>

If you apply for asylum and the immigration office is using incorrect personal information, you can ask them to pause using that data until it is reviewed and corrected.

As with other GDPR rights, the organisation must respond to your request within one month, and you can make the request by email or letter.

This right is especially useful when you want to pause the use of your personal data without having it deleted permanently.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 2 - Right to Data Portability</h2>
This right is covered under <strong>Article 20</strong> of the GDPR. It gives you the right to take your personal data from one company and move it to another. This helps you switch services more easily and keep control over your information.
<h3><strong>
</strong>There are some important rules:</h3>
It only applies if the data was provided by you directly to the company, not if it was collected from other sources. It can only be used if the data is processed based on your consent or as part of a contract. Also, it applies only when the data is handled by automatic systems, like websites or apps.

You can ask to receive your data in a machine-readable format, which means another company or service can use it easily.

<strong>Example:</strong>

If you use a fitness app that collects your weight, steps, or exercise data but want to switch to a different app, you can ask the old app to send your data to you or directly to the new app.

The company must provide your data free of charge and within one month, and it should be in a format that is easy to use.

This right is especially useful when you change banks, phone providers, email services, or want to manage your health, fitness, or shopping data.

<strong>
Remember:</strong> This right only covers data you have given to the service. It does not include data the service has created about you.
