&lt;p&gt;The adult educator&amp;rsquo;s role is critical in the digital safety of adult learners, particularly those who are vulnerable. Educators must be the first line of defense in teaching how to use digital tools by setting the standard for digital responsibility. This requires to continually learn and stay up-to-date on evolving data ethics, security risks, and educational platforms changes. By regularly vetting and choosing ethical and safe platforms, educators not only protect learner data but also serve as a crucial digital role model. Their informed decisions on accessibility and privacy directly demonstrate the safe practices they expect learners to follow, reinforcing that digital safety is a core part of digital literacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we focus in this unit on four critical areas: Auditing Data Privacy and Usage Policies to understand how information is handled; Evaluating Platform Accessibility and Inclusivity to ensure equitable access; Vetting Tools for Security Standards (Encryption &amp;amp; Storage) to guarantee technical protection; and applying The Ethical Checklist: Balancing Utility with Risk to make informed, responsible choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-1.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 1" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topic 1: Auditing Data Privacy and Usage Policies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators bear the professional and ethical responsibility to read and critically evaluate the privacy policies and Terms of Service (ToS) for every educational platform they introduce. This isn&amp;rsquo;t just best practice; it is a fundamental part of our role as digital role models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core challenge for adult learners, particularly migrants, is the language barrier and the use of dense legal jargon in these documents, which often leads to consent being granted without true understanding. The educator&amp;rsquo;s duty is to demystify these documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scrutinizing the Fine Print&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When auditing a policy, educators must look for clear answers on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Data Collection:&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly what Personal Identifying Information is gathered (e.g., name, location, learning metrics).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usage and Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; How the data is used (e.g., is it just for teaching, or is it used for behavioral advertising?) and, crucially, if it is shared with or sold to third parties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage and Retention:&lt;/strong&gt; Where data is stored (location matters for legal jurisdiction) and for how long it is retained after the learner leaves the program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building Critical Consent Behaviors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators must instill the habit of thoroughly reviewing any agreement before consenting. This mirrors the process for any real-world contract. For example, during a training for Ukrainian refugees in Poland, an activity was conducted where participants were given an agreement with the training provider in Ukrainian mid-session, under time pressure, asking them (at the end of the text) to agree to pay a fee at the end of the training. Some immediately signed without reading, some began reading, and others questioned the unexpected document. This powerful exercise was designed to highlight the automatic compliance many display and raise awareness that all agreements, especially those related to data, must be read in detail, regardless of urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators must create a safe space for learners to voice confusion or even &amp;ldquo;make mistakes&amp;rdquo; during these exercises, ensuring they develop the critical behavior of informed consent without fear of real-life negative consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-2.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topic 2 Evaluating Platform Accessibility and Inclusivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond security, an ethical educator must prioritize how given platforms ensure equitable access for all learners, particularly migrants who often face multiple barriers. This subtopic requires a proactive assessment of inclusivity features, moving past simple compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most critical factor is &lt;strong&gt;Language Support.&lt;/strong&gt; An inclusive platform must offer accurate translation features or, ideally, native multi-lingual interfaces. If a learning system or its content is only available in a dominant language, it creates an immediate, unfair barrier to comprehension and participation. Educators should test not just text translations, but also the translation of navigational elements and help documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt; extends to the design itself. A simple, uncluttered interface with predictable navigation reduces cognitive load, which is vital for learners who may have lower digital literacy or be dealing with significant personal stress. Platforms should be tested for compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies used by people with visual or reading impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, given that many migrant learners rely on mobile data or shared connections, we must assess low-bandwidth options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the platform offer a &amp;ldquo;lite&amp;rdquo; mode? Can videos be set to low resolution or downloaded offline? High-demand tools that frequently require large downloads or constant streaming are inherently unethical for a population that may be financially or geographically disadvantaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, we must advocate for platforms that view accessibility as an ethical imperative, not just an added feature. The goal is to ensure that a learner&amp;rsquo;s potential is never limited by the technological demands of the educational tool chosen by the educator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-3.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 3" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 3 Vetting Tools for Security Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vetting an educational platform&amp;rsquo;s technical security requires educators to look beyond marketing claims to analyze core features: encryption and storage. Technical audit ensures the platform has measures in place to prevent and mitigate unauthorized data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Encryption: Data in Motion and at Rest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must distinguish between two essential types of encryption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption In Transit:&lt;/strong&gt; This protects data as it travels between the learner&amp;rsquo;s device and the platform&amp;rsquo;s servers. Educators should verify that platforms use the latest protocols, such as TLS 1.3, ensuring data is scrambled during transmission. (This reinforces the earlier point about checking for HTTPS, but focuses on the protocol&amp;rsquo;s strength.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption At Rest:&lt;/strong&gt; This protects data when it is stored on the platform&amp;rsquo;s servers or cloud databases. Tools should utilize strong standards like AES-256. For example, a platform storing learner progress reports must encrypt the database itself, so even if a hacker gains unauthorized access to the server, the files remain unreadable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data Localization and Storage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For migrant populations, the physical location of stored data (data localization) carries significant legal weight. Educators should investigate where the platform&amp;rsquo;s servers are located (e.g., within the EU, the US, or elsewhere). Data stored within the European Union, for instance, offers the protection of GDPR, while storage in other regions may subject learners&amp;rsquo; PII to different surveillance or disclosure laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assessing the Platform Provider&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key security step is to vet the provider itself. Educators should assess the vendor&amp;rsquo;s reputation, asking critical questions: How long has the company been operating? Are they financially stable? A platform suddenly shutting down due to financial instability can lead to an abrupt loss of data or, worse, unmanaged data exposure. We should look for public reports of past data breaches or security lapses and evaluate how transparently and effectively the company handled the incident. Furthermore, the provider must offer reliable and timely security updates and patches to fix vulnerabilities, ensuring the platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a weak link in the learner&amp;rsquo;s digital environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secure platform must also demonstrate robust protection against unauthorized data breaches by having clear access controls. Ask: Does the platform limit access to PII only to personnel who strictly need it? Does it provide logs of who has accessed learner data and when? These practical checks determine if a tool is built with adequate technical safeguards to manage high-risk information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topic 4 The Ethical Checklist: Balancing Utility with Risk in Digital Tool Selection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing digital tools requires educators to engage in a structured, ethical balancing act, moving beyond simple features to weigh the inherent functional utility against potential ethical risks for vulnerable learners. This process ensures we prioritize learner safety and rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before adopting any platform, the educator must master the tool itself. This means thoroughly knowing the platform&amp;rsquo;s features, limitations, and settings to be completely prepared to answer learner questions immediately. The educator must also actively check the platform for clear contact details or an inquiry pathway (e.g., a security or data protection officer). This readiness ensures that if a learner encounters an issue or a security concern arises, the educator can promptly address it or pass the inquiry to the vendor. This level of internal expertise and vendor access significantly increases the safety of the platform for the learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Need&amp;rdquo; Test (Functional Utility)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must determine if the platform offers a significant pedagogical value that genuinely improves learning, rather than being a non-essential novelty. Furthermore, its utility must be assessed through an inclusivity lens: is it easy to use for those with lower digital literacy, does it integrate seamlessly with existing, trusted school systems, and does it remain low-resource friendly, functioning well on older mobile devices or low-bandwidth connections? If the benefits are marginal, the ethical decision is to reject it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Harm&amp;rdquo; Test (Ethical and Security Risk)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the utility is high, we proceed to the intensive &amp;ldquo;Harm&amp;rdquo; Test. This involves a rigorous assessment of all identified risks. We must confirm the tool adheres to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the absolute minimum PII necessary, avoiding unnecessary data points like location or contacts. Crucially, the Privacy Policy must explicitly state that PII is not sold or shared with unwanted advertisers or third parties. We also consider vendor trust by checking the provider&amp;rsquo;s history for past breaches and confirming they offer reliable security updates and strong encryption. Finally, we evaluate the consent clarity, ensuring the process is simple and transparent, preventing accidental agreement due to a language barrier or confusing jargon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, if a tool presents a High Risk across any ethical checkpoints&amp;mdash;such as excessive data collection or weak encryption&amp;mdash;those risks inherently outweigh any functional utility. The educator&amp;rsquo;s ethical duty is to reject such tools, protecting the learner from potential exploitation and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamification &amp;Alpha;ctivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity Title: Digital Ethics and Security Fill in the blanks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete the blanks with the appropriate words to ensure the sentences reflect the principles&amp;nbsp;discussed in the unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[h5p id="50"]&lt;/p&gt;</source><target>&lt;h2&gt;Вступ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Роль викладача дорослих є критично важливою для цифрової безпеки дорослих учнів, особливо тих, хто є вразливим. Викладачі мають бути першою лінією захисту у навчанні користуванню цифровими інструментами, встановлюючи стандарт цифрової відповідальності. Це вимагає постійного навчання та відстеження змін у сфері етики даних, ризиків безпеки та змін освітніх платформ. Регулярно перевіряючи та обираючи етичні й безпечні платформи, викладачі не лише захищають дані учнів, а й слугують важливим цифровим прикладом для наслідування. Їхні обґрунтовані рішення щодо доступності та конфіденційності наочно демонструють безпечні практики, яких вони очікують від учнів, підкреслюючи, що цифрова безпека є невід’ємною частиною цифрової грамотності.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Щоб досягти цього, у цьому модулі ми зосереджуємося на чотирьох ключових напрямках: аудит політик конфіденційності та використання даних для розуміння, як обробляється інформація; оцінка доступності та інклюзивності платформи для забезпечення рівного доступу; перевірка інструментів на відповідність стандартам безпеки (шифрування та зберігання) для гарантії технічного захисту; і застосування етичного чек-листа: балансування користі та ризику для прийняття обґрунтованих, відповідальних рішень.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-1.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 1" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Тема 1: Аудит політик конфіденційності та використання даних&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Викладачі несуть професійну та етичну відповідальність читати й критично оцінювати політики конфіденційності та умови використання (ToS) кожної освітньої платформи, яку вони впроваджують. Це не просто найкраща практика; це фундаментальна частина нашої ролі як цифрових прикладів для наслідування.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Основною проблемою для дорослих учнів, особливо мігрантів, є мовний бар’єр і використання складної юридичної термінології в цих документах, що часто призводить до надання згоди без справжнього розуміння. Обов’язок викладача — роз’яснювати ці документи.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Уважний аналіз дрібного шрифту&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Проводячи аудит політики, викладачі мають шукати чіткі відповіді на такі питання:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Збір персональних даних:&lt;/strong&gt; Яку саме особисту ідентифікаційну інформацію збирають (наприклад, ім’я, місцезнаходження, навчальні показники).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Використання та передача:&lt;/strong&gt; Як використовуються дані (наприклад, лише для навчання чи для поведінкової реклами?) і, що важливо, чи передаються або продаються вони третім сторонам.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Зберігання та утримання:&lt;/strong&gt; Де зберігаються дані (місцезнаходження важливе для юридичної юрисдикції) і як довго вони зберігаються після завершення навчання учнем.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Формування критичної поведінки щодо згоди&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Викладачі мають прищеплювати звичку ретельно переглядати будь-яку угоду перед наданням згоди. Це відображає процес підписання будь-якого реального контракту. Наприклад, під час тренінгу для українських біженців у Польщі було проведено вправу, коли учасникам посеред заняття під тиском часу видали угоду з провайдером тренінгу українською мовою, в кінці якої просили погодитися на оплату після завершення навчання. Дехто підписав одразу, не читаючи, дехто почав читати, а інші поставили питання щодо несподіваного документа. Ця потужна вправа була спрямована на те, щоб показати автоматичну покірність багатьох людей і підвищити обізнаність про те, що всі угоди, особливо пов’язані з даними, потрібно читати детально, незалежно від терміновості.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Викладачі мають створити безпечний простір для учнів, щоб вони могли висловлювати нерозуміння або навіть «помилятися» під час таких вправ, забезпечуючи формування критичної поведінки щодо усвідомленої згоди без страху реальних негативних наслідків.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-2.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Тема 2 Оцінка доступності та інклюзивності платформи&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Окрім безпеки, етичний викладач має приділяти пріоритетну увагу тому, як обрані платформи забезпечують рівний доступ для всіх учнів, особливо мігрантів, які часто стикаються з численними бар’єрами. Ця підтема вимагає проактивної оцінки інклюзивних функцій, виходячи за межі простого дотримання вимог.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Найважливішим фактором є &lt;strong&gt;мовна підтримка.&lt;/strong&gt; Інклюзивна платформа повинна мати точні функції перекладу або, в ідеалі, рідні багатомовні інтерфейси. Якщо система навчання чи її контент доступні лише основною мовою, це створює негайний і несправедливий бар’єр для розуміння та участі. Викладачі мають перевіряти не лише переклад тексту, а й переклад навігаційних елементів і довідкової документації.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Доступність&lt;/strong&gt; стосується й самого дизайну. Простий, не перевантажений інтерфейс із передбачуваною навігацією зменшує когнітивне навантаження, що важливо для учнів із низьким рівнем цифрової грамотності або тих, хто перебуває у стресі. Платформи мають бути протестовані на сумісність із програмами для читання з екрана та іншими допоміжними технологіями для людей із порушеннями зору чи читання.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Важливо, що багато мігрантів залежать від мобільного інтернету або спільних підключень, тому потрібно оцінювати можливості для роботи при низькій пропускній здатності.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Чи пропонує платформа «легкий» режим? Чи можна встановити низьку роздільну здатність відео або завантажити їх для перегляду офлайн? Інструменти, які часто вимагають великих завантажень або постійного потокового передавання, є неетичними для аудиторії, яка може бути фінансово чи географічно обмеженою.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Зрештою, ми маємо відстоювати платформи, які розглядають доступність як етичний імператив, а не просто додаткову функцію. Мета — гарантувати, що потенціал учня ніколи не буде обмежений технологічними вимогами освітнього інструменту, обраного викладачем.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.3-Unit-3-Choosing-Ethical-and-Accessible-Digital-Tools-3.webp" alt="7.3 Unit 3 - Choosing Ethical and Accessible Digital Tools 3" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Тема 3 Перевірка інструментів на відповідність стандартам безпеки&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Перевірка технічної безпеки освітньої платформи вимагає від викладачів виходити за межі маркетингових заяв і аналізувати основні функції: шифрування та зберігання. Технічний аудит гарантує, що платформа має заходи для запобігання та пом’якшення несанкціонованих витоків даних.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Шифрування: дані в русі та на зберіганні&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ми маємо розрізняти два основних типи шифрування:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Шифрування під час передачі:&lt;/strong&gt; Захищає дані під час їх передачі між пристроєм учня та серверами платформи. Викладачі мають переконатися, що платформи використовують сучасні протоколи, такі як TLS 1.3, щоб дані були зашифровані під час передачі. (Це підсилює попередню думку про перевірку HTTPS, але акцентує увагу на силі протоколу.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Шифрування на зберіганні:&lt;/strong&gt; Захищає дані, коли вони зберігаються на серверах платформи або у хмарних базах даних. Інструменти мають використовувати надійні стандарти, такі як AES-256. Наприклад, платформа, яка зберігає звіти про успішність учнів, повинна шифрувати саму базу даних, щоб навіть у разі несанкціонованого доступу до сервера файли залишалися нерозшифрованими.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Локалізація та зберігання даних&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для мігрантів фізичне розташування збережених даних (локалізація даних) має значну юридичну вагу. Викладачі мають з’ясувати, де розташовані сервери платформи (наприклад, у ЄС, США чи в іншому місці). Дані, збережені в межах Європейського Союзу, наприклад, захищені GDPR, тоді як зберігання в інших регіонах може підпорядковувати персональні дані учнів іншим законам про нагляд чи розкриття інформації.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Оцінка постачальника платформи&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ключовим кроком безпеки є перевірка самого постачальника. Викладачі мають оцінити репутацію постачальника, поставивши критичні питання: скільки років компанія працює? Чи є вона фінансово стабільною? Раптове закриття платформи через фінансову нестабільність може призвести до раптової втрати даних або, що гірше, до неконтрольованого витоку даних. Слід шукати публічні звіти про минулі витоки даних чи порушення безпеки та оцінити, наскільки прозоро й ефективно компанія впоралася з інцидентом. Крім того, постачальник має надавати надійні та своєчасні оновлення безпеки й патчі для усунення вразливостей, щоб платформа не стала слабкою ланкою у цифровому середовищі учня.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Безпечна платформа також має демонструвати надійний захист від несанкціонованих витоків даних завдяки чітким механізмам контролю доступу. Запитайте: чи обмежує платформа доступ до персональних даних лише тим працівникам, яким це дійсно потрібно? Чи надає вона журнали доступу до даних учнів і часу такого доступу? Ці практичні перевірки визначають, чи інструмент має достатні технічні засоби для захисту інформації з високим рівнем ризику.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Тема 4 Етичний чек-лист: баланс користі та ризику при виборі цифрових інструментів&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Вибір цифрових інструментів вимагає від викладачів структурованого, етичного підходу, що виходить за межі простого аналізу функцій і зважує функціональну користь проти потенційних етичних ризиків для вразливих учнів. Цей процес гарантує, що ми ставимо на перше місце безпеку та права учнів.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Перед впровадженням будь-якої платформи викладач має досконало опанувати сам інструмент. Це означає повне знання функцій, обмежень і налаштувань платформи, щоб одразу відповідати на запитання учнів. Викладач також має перевірити наявність чітких контактних даних або шляху для звернення (наприклад, до спеціаліста з безпеки чи захисту даних). Така готовність гарантує, що у разі виникнення проблеми чи питання безпеки викладач зможе оперативно відреагувати або передати запит постачальнику. Такий рівень внутрішньої експертизи та доступу до постачальника значно підвищує безпеку платформи для учнів.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Тест «Потреба» (функціональна користь)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ми маємо визначити, чи платформа надає значну педагогічну цінність, яка дійсно покращує навчання, а не є другорядною новинкою. Крім того, її користь слід оцінювати з точки зору інклюзивності: чи легко нею користуватися людям із низькою цифровою грамотністю, чи інтегрується вона з існуючими, перевіреними шкільними системами, і чи залишається вона дружньою до пристроїв із низькими ресурсами, працюючи на старих мобільних пристроях або при низькій швидкості інтернету? Якщо користь незначна, етичне рішення — відмовитися від неї.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Тест «Шкода» (етичний та безпековий ризик)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Якщо користь висока, переходимо до поглибленого тесту «Шкода». Це передбачає ретельну оцінку всіх виявлених ризиків. Ми маємо переконатися, що інструмент дотримується принципу мінімізації даних, збираючи лише мінімально необхідні персональні дані, уникаючи зайвих, таких як місцезнаходження чи контакти. Важливо, щоб політика конфіденційності чітко зазначала, що персональні дані не продаються і не передаються небажаним рекламодавцям чи третім сторонам. Також враховується довіра до постачальника шляхом перевірки історії порушень безпеки та підтвердження, що він надає надійні оновлення безпеки та сильне шифрування. Нарешті, оцінюється прозорість процесу згоди, щоб він був простим і зрозумілим, не допускаючи випадкової згоди через мовний бар’єр чи заплутану термінологію.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Зрештою, якщо інструмент має високий ризик за будь-яким етичним критерієм — наприклад, надмірний збір даних або слабке шифрування — ці ризики переважають будь-яку функціональну користь. Етичний обов’язок викладача — відмовитися від таких інструментів, захищаючи учня від потенційної експлуатації та вразливості.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Гейміфікаційна &amp;Alpha;ктивність&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Назва активності: Етика та безпека в цифровому середовищі — заповни пропуски&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Заповніть пропуски відповідними словами, щоб речення відображали принципи, розглянуті в модулі.&lt;/p&gt;
