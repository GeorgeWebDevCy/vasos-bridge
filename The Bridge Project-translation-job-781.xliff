Your personal data can’t be collected or used freely. The GDPR defines specific situations when data processing is permitted. In this unit, you will learn when your data can be collected without your consent, and when your permission is absolutely required. You will also understand what “consent” really means and how to recognise whether it is valid. Finally, we look at how the rules apply to children’s personal data, which have extra protection. Knowing this helps you stay in control and make informed decisions about what data you share and with whom.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 1 - When is Data Processing Allowed</h2>
Your personal data can only be collected or used if there is a valid reason. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines several situations when data processing is allowed without your consent:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>There is a contract with you:</strong> If you buy something online, the seller needs your name and address to deliver the product. That’s part of the contract, so they are allowed to collect and use this data.</li>
 	<li><strong>There is a legal obligation:</strong> Sometimes the law requires your data to be collected. For example, you must report your place of residence to the local authorities. They are legally required to store that information.</li>
 	<li><strong>It’s necessary to protect someone’s vital interests:</strong> In emergency situations, your personal data can be used to protect your life or health. For instance, if you are unconscious and taken to a hospital, doctors can access your medical records without needing your consent.</li>
 	<li><strong>It’s needed to perform a public task:</strong> Public institutions like schools or social services may collect and process your data as part of their official duties. For example, when enrolling a child in school, the school collects personal details to ensure proper registration.</li>
 	<li><strong>The organisation has a legitimate interest:</strong> This basis requires a clear and current interest, something linked to the organisation’s present activities or benefits expected soon. Interests that are too vague or hypothetical are not enough. An organisation can use your data only after making sure that your fundamental rights and freedoms are not seriously affected. If your rights outweigh the organisation’s interests, processing cannot be based on legitimate interest.</li>
</ol>
For example, by law, an organisation must keep job applicants’ personal details for six months. It decides to store them for longer, as some applicants might not have been suitable for the advertised role but could be a good fit for a future position. If the risk of misuse is low, the data is kept securely, and applicants are informed, this can be considered a legitimate interest.

If none of the above apply, your data can only be collected with your permission. For example, when you sign up for a newsletter or agree to have your photo published, you must be clearly informed and actively agree.

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 2 - Understanding Consent and Your Choices</h2>
In many situations, organisations are only allowed to use your personal data if you give them your consent. But what does “consent” really mean, and how can you make sure it’s valid?

<strong>Before you give consent, the organisation must clearly explain:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Who they are and how to contact them</li>
 	<li>Why they want to use your data</li>
 	<li>How long they plan to keep your data</li>
 	<li>Whether your data will be shared with others</li>
 	<li>What your rights are (to access, correct, delete your data, complain, or withdraw consent)</li>
</ul>
This information must be shared in clear and plain language. This means a message should be easily understandable for the average person and not only for lawyers.

Consent must be given freely, clearly and actively. It can be collected through a written or recorded oral statement, including by electronic means. For example, by signing a form or clicking “I agree” on a website. Just leaving a pre-ticked box or not saying anything does not count as consent.

Sometimes consent can be given in other ways than clicking a button or signing a form. For example, swiping a bar on a screen, waving in front of a smart camera, or turning your phone in a certain way could all be used to show agreement — but only if you are clearly told what the action means and it is linked to a specific request. The organisation must be able to prove that you agreed in this way, and you must be able to withdraw your consent just as easily.

However, simply scrolling down or swiping through a website is not enough. People may not notice a small note saying that scrolling means consent, and the action is not clear enough to count as a valid “yes”.

<h2>Topic 3 - Personal Data of Children</h2>
Children have the same data protection rights as adults, but the GDPR introduces additional safeguards to protect them. This is because children may not fully understand the risks of sharing their personal data online.

One of the key requirements is parental consent. If a child wants to use online services such as social media, streaming platforms, or games that collect personal data, the service must first obtain verified consent from a parent or legal guardian. The default age of digital consent under the GDPR is 16, but individual EU countries may lower this threshold to 13. Each service must take reasonable steps to confirm that the consent is genuine, for example, by sending a verification email to the parent or asking for documentation.

Children must also be given information about how their data will be used in a way they can understand. Any text, forms, or settings aimed at children should use clear and simple language.

A child might not need a parent’s permission to use help or support services that are in their best interests. For example, they can contact an online counselling chat for psychological help, including in situations where it may not be safe or possible to involve their parents.

Understanding these rules is important for parents and children alike, especially when using digital tools, websites, and apps designed for or accessible to minors.
