misuse, cybercrime, and&nbsp;virtual threats in the broadest sense. Rise awareness of cybercrime</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This unit addresses the critical need for educators to become digital security advocates for their learners. As technology use expands, so do risks like data misuse and cybercrime. For vulnerable groups, such as migrant women, these threats are often amplified, putting their privacy, safety, and stability at greater risk from virtual threats in the broadest sense. This module provides the essential knowledge to identify, prevent, and respond to these dangers. By raising awareness of cybercrime and digital vulnerabilities, educators will be empowered to establish secure learning environments and equip migrant women with the practical skills needed to navigate the digital world safely and confidently.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h2>Topic 1 Understanding the Scope of Virtual Threats and Scams Against Vulnerable Populations</h2>
<p>The scale and complexity of online scams have surged globally, becoming one of the most popular crimes in the digital age. This &ldquo;scamdemic&rdquo; accelerated with increased digital reliance due to global events, dramatically amplifying the attack surface for cybercriminals. We&rsquo;re used to protecting the places where we live, but now we need to protect the personal data we share on our phones and computers even more than the places we physically live in.</p>
<p>While younger adults often report higher rates of financial loss due to investment or shopping scams, vulnerable populations, including migrant women and refugees, are disproportionately targeted due to factors like isolation, urgent financial need, lower digital literacy, and language barriers.</p>
<p>The urgency and instability of displacement create a perfect environment for exploitation. For women, this threat is even higher: nearly three-quarters of women online have been exposed to some form of cyber violence, and a significant portion of technology-facilitated violence includes financial fraud and misuse of personal data.</p>
<p>In the context of the Ukrainian refugee crisis, especially in host countries like Poland, criminals quickly capitalized on humanitarian needs.</p>
<p><strong><br>For example scams directly impacting Ukrainian refugees have included:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fake Financial Assistance Phishing:</strong> Malicious websites and social media posts impersonating official organizations or foreign partners (like the UN or EU) offer &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; non-existent aid. Victims are asked to enter their bank card details or national identity numbers (like the Polish PESEL) on fake pages, leading to immediate financial theft or identity fraud.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Personal Data Collection Scams:</strong> Fraudulent announcements, sometimes via email or social media, purport to be from government departments (like Poland&rsquo;s Department for Foreigners). They request refugees&rsquo; personal data, or data about the refugee from their Polish hosts, under the guise of an official update or diplomatic mission, making the refugees vulnerable to further exploitation or even trafficking.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Job and Housing Fraud:</strong> Scammers advertise high-paying jobs or rent-free accommodation on platforms like Facebook groups and Telegram channels, then demand an upfront &ldquo;fee,&rdquo; a deposit, or personal data to secure the non-existent opportunity, leaving the refugee stranded and poorer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The immense scale of this targeting&mdash;often utilizing sophisticated social engineering to prey on trust and desperation&mdash;underscores the urgent need for critical digital literacy and clear online protection measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Topic 2 Mitigating Data Misuse and Digital Privacy Risks. Educators&rsquo; Role</h2>
<p>As for adult educators, the core role is to support adult learners, particularly those who are migrants, in mitigating data misuse and raising awareness of digital privacy risks. During any consultation, training (whether face-to-face or online), educators need to continually equip learners with the knowledge and tips necessary to manage their personal information safely. This includes providing practical, up-to-date examples of data misuse, which are regularly available on government, specialist, and media websites, to ensure everyone stays informed.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Understanding the Risks to Sensitive Data</h3>
<p>Adult learners, especially migrants, face significant risks related to data misuse and the exposure of Personal Identifying Information (PII). Educational and administrative records, such as immigration status, current location, contact details, and learning progress, are highly sensitive. If exposed, this data can be exploited by criminals for identity theft, extortion, or to target individuals with highly personalized scams, putting their physical and financial safety at risk. The urgency and vulnerability of their situation often make them less likely to thoroughly scrutinize who is collecting their information. To address these vulnerabilities, learners must adopt proactive data hygiene practices.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Practical Privacy Management</h3>
<p>Learners should actively manage privacy across all their devices and platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Our training should cover these actionable steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review App Permissions:</strong> Teach learners to regularly check which mobile apps have access to sensitive features like the microphone, camera, contacts, or precise location, and to disable unnecessary permissions.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Secure Learning Platforms:</strong> Learners must be familiar with the security and privacy settings of educational platforms (e.g., Moodle, Google Classroom). They must know how to adjust sharing settings to ensure private work and communication remain confidential.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Minimize Data Sharing:</strong> Encourage learners to default to sharing the least amount of PII possible on social media and other public sites. Emphasize the importance of treating every online form and request for personal details with suspicion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Core Security Principles</h3>
<p><strong>Teaching these technical principles is foundational to personal protection and resilience:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong Passwords and 2FA:</strong> We must emphasize creating unique, complex passwords for every account. The use of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)&mdash;which requires a second verification step (like a code sent to a phone)&mdash;is crucial as it prevents unauthorized access even if a password is stolen.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Recognizing Secure Connections:</strong> Teach learners to verify a website&rsquo;s security by looking for HTTPS at the beginning of the web address and a padlock icon in the browser bar. This simple step indicates that the connection is encrypted, making it safer for submitting sensitive data. Learners must understand that unsecured (HTTP) sites are vulnerable to data interception.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Topic 3 Cybercrime Awareness and Critical Digital Literacy Skills</h2>
<p>To protect adult learners, particularly vulnerable migrants, educators must focus the training on Cybercrime Awareness and Critical Digital Literacy. This goes beyond mere technical steps to address the psychological manipulation inherent in online threats.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Understanding the Threats</h3>
<p>Learners must be able to define common cybercrimes relevant to their situation: Identity Theft, Financial Fraud, and Non-Consensual Image Sharing to name just a few examples.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Developing Critical Digital Literacy</h3>
<p>Critical literacy is essential for evaluating the vast amount of online information, especially when seeking aid or employment.</p>
<p><strong>Learners must be trained to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evaluate Online Sources:</strong> Question the source, date, and motive of information, especially if it elicits a strong emotional response. Teach them to cross-reference news and aid offers with official government or major NGO websites, not just social media.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Combat Mis/Disinformation:</strong> Recognize that &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and harmful disinformation are often designed to encourage fear, confusion, or mistrust in official systems (like migration centers or banks).</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Recognizing Social Engineering</h3>
<p>The most effective way to avoid scams is by recognizing social engineering&mdash;the act of manipulating people into giving up confidential information. Practical techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spotting Urgency and Authority:</strong> Scammers often create a false sense of urgency (&ldquo;Your account will be closed in 10 minutes!&rdquo;) or impersonate figures of authority (bank managers, police, government officials) to bypass critical thinking.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Never Click or Call Back:</strong> Treat unexpected calls, texts, or emails (phishing) asking for data or money with extreme skepticism. Teach the rule: Never click a link or call a number provided in a suspicious message; instead, independently look up the legitimate number or website to verify.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="7.1 Unit 2 - Foundations of Digital Ethics 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/7.1-Unit-2-Foundations-of-Digital-Ethics-3.webp" alt="7.1 Unit 2 - Foundations of Digital Ethics 3" width="auto" height="auto"><br>Topic 4 The Educator's Role: Intervention, Reporting, and Resource Mapping</h2>
<p>The educator&rsquo;s responsibility extends beyond teaching security tips; it requires establishing a clear, sensitive protocol for intervention and support when a learner discloses a cyber threat or scam. The immediate goal is to prioritize the learner&rsquo;s safety and stop the harm.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Protocols for Intervention and Support</h3>
<p>When a learner reports an incident, educators must adopt a trauma-informed approach, focusing first on emotional validation and practical steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Safety First:</strong> Assess if the threat involves physical danger or real-world stalking. If so, emergency services must be contacted immediately, following institutional protocols.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Evidence Collection:</strong> Advise the learner to preserve all digital evidence. This means not deleting messages, not blocking the perpetrator immediately (if it means losing evidence), and taking screenshots or making video recordings of the communications. This is crucial for any potential legal action like contacting the police.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Additional Support:</strong> Guide the learner through immediate technical support: changing passwords on a separate, secure device; freezing bank accounts if money was lost; or temporarily disabling the compromised social media account.</li>
</ol>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Legal and Institutional Reporting</h3>
<p>Educators must be knowledgeable about the formal pathways available, differentiating between reporting to the platform and reporting to law enforcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform Reporting:</strong> For content like harassment, non-consensual image sharing, or fake profiles, the educator should help the learner use the platform&rsquo;s (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) built-in reporting tools. These are often the fastest way to remove harmful content.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Institutional Reporting:</strong> Institutions (colleges, training centers) usually have internal incident reporting mechanisms. This is vital for addressing abuse involving other students, staff, or the misuse of the educational platform itself.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> For crimes like extortion, serious identity theft, or physical threats, reporting to the police or a national cybercrime unit is necessary. The educator&rsquo;s role is to provide the information and support the learner through the process, which can be daunting for migrants who may fear authorities due to their status.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Resource Mapping and External Support</h3>
<p>Victims of digital abuse, particularly migrant women who may also be survivors of domestic or gender-based violence, require specialized, culturally competent help. Educators must maintain a current map of external resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialist Helplines:</strong> Identify national domestic abuse helplines that offer multi-lingual support and understand the intersection of online abuse and immigration status. Look for organizations that specialize in supporting Black and minoritized ethnic (BAME) women, as they often provide holistic, culturally-adapted services.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Legal Aid and Counseling:</strong> Map free legal aid services that can advise on digital protection orders, data privacy laws, or dealing with threats from abusers overseas. Ensure that counseling and mental health support services are available to address the significant trauma caused by cyber and digital harassment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Θέμα 1 Κατανόηση του Πεδίου των Εικονικών Απειλών και των Απατών κατά των Ευάλωτων Πληθυσμών</h2>
<p>Η κλίμακα και η πολυπλοκότητα των διαδικτυακών απατών έχουν αυξηθεί παγκοσμίως, καθιστώντας τις ένα από τα πιο δημοφιλή εγκλήματα στην ψηφιακή εποχή. Αυτή η «σκαμδημία» (scamdemic) επιταχύνθηκε με την αυξημένη εξάρτηση από την ψηφιακή τεχνολογία λόγω παγκόσμιων γεγονότων, ενισχύοντας δραματικά την επιφάνεια επίθεσης για τους κυβερνοεγκληματίες. Είμαστε συνηθισμένοι να προστατεύουμε τους χώρους όπου ζούμε, αλλά τώρα πρέπει να προστατεύουμε τα προσωπικά δεδομένα που μοιραζόμαστε στα τηλέφωνα και στους υπολογιστές μας ακόμη περισσότερο από τους χώρους στους οποίους κατοικούμε φυσικά.</p>
<p>Ενώς οι νεότεροι ενήλικες αναφέρουν συχνά υψηλότερα ποσοστά οικονομικών απωλειών λόγω επενδυτικών απατών ή απατών στις αγορές, οι ευάλωτοι πληθυσμοί, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των γυναικών μεταναστριών και των προσφύγων, αποτελούν δυσανάλογο στόχο λόγω παραγόντων όπως η απομόνωση, η επείγουσα οικονομική ανάγκη, ο χαμηλότερος ψηφιακός γραμματισμός και τα γλωσσικά εμπόδια.</p>
<p>Ο επείγων χαρακτήρας και η αστάθεια του εκτοπισμού δημιουργούν ένα τέλειο περιβάλλον για εκμετάλλευση. Για τις γυναίκες, αυτή η απειλή είναι ακόμη υψηλότερη: σχεδόν τα τρία τέταρτα των γυναικών στο διαδίκτυο έχουν εκτεθεί σε κάποια μορφή κυβερνοβίας, και ένα σημαντικό μέρος της βίας που διευκολύνεται από την τεχνολογία περιλαμβάνει την οικονομική απάτη και την κατάχρηση προσωπικών δεδομένων.</p>
<p>Στο πλαίσιο της ουκρανικής προσφυγικής κρίσης, ειδικά σε χώρες υποδοχής όπως η Πολωνία, οι εγκληματίες εκμεταλλεύτηκαν γρήγορα τις ανθρωπιστικές ανάγκες.</p>
<p><strong><br>Για παράδειγμα, οι απάτες που επηρεάζουν άμεσα τους Ουκρανούς πρόσφυγες περιλαμβάνουν:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ψάρεμα (Phishing) Ψεύτικης Οικονομικής Βοήθειας:</strong> Κακόβουλοι ιστότοποι και αναρτήσεις στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης που υποδύονται επίσημους οργανισμούς ή ξένους εταίρους (όπως ο ΟΗΕ ή η ΕΕ) προσφέρουν «επείγουσα» ανύπαρκτη βοήθεια. Ζητείται από τα θύματα να εισαγάγουν τα στοιχεία της τραπεζικής τους κάρτας ή τους αριθμούς εθνικής ταυτότητας (όπως το πολωνικό PESEL) σε ψεύτικες σελίδες, οδηγώντας σε άμεση οικονομική κλοπή ή απάτη ταυτότητας.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Απάτες Συλλογής Προσωπικών Δεδομένων:</strong> Δόλιες ανακοινώσεις, μερικές φορές μέσω ηλεκτρονικού ταχυδρομείου ή μέσων κοινωνικής δικτύωσης, που ισχυρίζονται ότι προέρχονται από κυβερνητικά τμήματα (όπως το Τμήμα Αλλοδαπών της Πολωνίας). Ζητούν προσωπικά δεδομένα προσφύγων, ή δεδομένα για τον πρόσφυγα από τους Πολωνούς οικοδεσπότες τους, υπό το πρόσχημα μιας επίσημης ενημέρωσης ή διπλωματικής αποστολής, καθιστώντας τους πρόσφυγες ευάλωτους σε περαιτέρω εκμετάλλευση ή ακόμη και εμπορία ανθρώπων.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Απάτη σχετικά με την Εργασία και τη Στέγαση:</strong> Οι απατεώνες διαφημίζουν καλοπληρωμένες δουλειές ή στέγαση χωρίς ενοίκιο σε πλατφόρμες όπως οι ομάδες του Facebook και τα κανάλια του Telegram, και στη συνέχεια απαιτούν μια προκαταβολική «αμοιβή», μια κατάθεση ή προσωπικά δεδομένα για να εξασφαλίσουν την ανύπαρκτη ευκαιρία, αφήνοντας τον πρόσφυγα ξεκρέμαστο και φτωχότερο.</li>
</ul>
<p>Η τεράστια κλίμακα αυτής της στοχοποίησης — συχνά χρησιμοποιώντας εξελιγμένη κοινωνική μηχανική για να εκμεταλλευτεί την εμπιστοσύνη και την απελπισία — υπογραμμίζει την επείγουσα ανάγκη για κριτικό ψηφιακό γραμματισμό και σαφή μέτρα διαδικτυακής προστασίας.</p>

<h2>Θέμα 2 Μετριασμός της Κατάχρησης Δεδομένων και Κίνδυνοι Ψηφιακού Απορρήτου. Ο Ρόλος των Εκπαιδευτικών</h2>
<p>Όσον αφορά τους εκπαιδευτές ενηλίκων, ο βασικός ρόλος είναι να υποστηρίζουν τους ενήλικες εκπαιδευόμενους, ιδιαίτερα εκείνους που είναι μετανάστες, στον μετριασμό της κατάχρησης δεδομένων και στην ευαισθητοποίηση σχετικά με τους κινδύνους της ψηφιακής ιδιωτικότητας. Κατά τη διάρκεια οποιασδήποτε συνεδρίας συμβουλευτικής ή εκπαίδευσης (είτε δια ζώσης είτε διαδικτυακά), οι εκπαιδευτικοί πρέπει να εξοπλίζουν συνεχώς τους εκπαιδευόμενους με τις απαραίτητες γνώσεις και συμβουλές για την ασφαλή διαχείριση των προσωπικών τους πληροφοριών. Αυτό περιλαμβάνει την παροχή πρακτικών, ενημερωμένων παραδειγμάτων κατάχρησης δεδομένων, τα οποία είναι τακτικά διαθέσιμα σε κυβερνητικούς, ειδικούς και ενημερωτικούς ιστότοπους, ώστε να διασφαλίζεται ότι όλοι παραμένουν ενημερωμένοι.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Κατανόηση των Κινδύνων για τα Ευαίσθητα Δεδομένα</h3>
<p>Οι ενήλικες εκπαιδευόμενοι, ειδικά οι μετανάστες, αντιμετωπίζουν σημαντικούς κινδύνους που σχετίζονται με την κατάχρηση δεδομένων και την έκθεση Πληροφοριών Προσωπικής Ταυτοποίησης (PII). Τα εκπαιδευτικά και διοικητικά αρχεία, όπως το καθεστώς μετανάστευσης, η τρέχουσα τοποθεσία, τα στοιχεία επικοινωνίας και η μαθησιακή πρόοδος, είναι εξαιρετικά ευαίσθητα. Εάν εκτεθούν, αυτά τα δεδομένα μπορούν να χρησιμοποιηθούν από εγκληματίες για κλοπή ταυτότητας, εκβιασμό ή για τη στόχευση ατόμων με εξαιρετικά εξατομικευμένες απάτες, θέτοντας σε κίνδυνο τη φυσική και οικονομική τους ασφάλεια. Ο επείγων χαρακτήρας και η ευαλωτότητα της κατάστασής τους συχνά τους καθιστούν λιγότερο πιθανό να ελέγξουν εξονυχιστικά ποιος συλλέγει τις πληροφορίες τους. Για την αντιμετώπιση αυτών των ευπαθειών, οι εκπαιδευόμενοι πρέπει να υιοθετήσουν προληπτικές πρακτικές ψηφιακής υγιεινής.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Πρακτική Διαχείριση της Ιδιωτικότητας</h3>
<p>Οι εκπαιδευόμενοι θα πρέπει να διαχειρίζονται ενεργά την ιδιωτικότητα σε όλες τις συσκευές και τις πλατφόρμες τους.</p>
<p><strong>Η εκπαίδευσή μας θα πρέπει να καλύπτει αυτά τα υλοποιήσιμα βήματα:</strong></p>

<li><strong>Έλεγχος Αδειών Εφαρμογών:</strong> Διδάξτε στους εκπαιδευόμενους να ελέγχουν τακτικά ποιες εφαρμογές κινητών τηλεφώνων έχουν πρόσβαση σε ευαίσθητες λειτουργίες όπως το μικρόφωνο, η κάμερα, οι επαφές ή η ακριβής τοποθεσία, και να απενεργοποιούν τις περιττές άδειες.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Ασφαλείς Πλατφόρμες Μάθησης:</strong> Οι εκπαιδευόμενοι πρέπει να είναι εξοικειωμένοι με τις ρυθμίσεις ασφάλειας και ιδιωτικότητας των εκπαιδευτικών πλατφορμών (π.χ. Moodle, Google Classroom). Πρέπει να γνωρίζουν πώς να προσαρμόζουν τις ρυθμίσεις κοινής χρήσης για να διασφαλίζουν ότι η ιδιωτική εργασία και η επικοινωνία παραμένουν εμπιστευτικές.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Ελαχιστοποίηση Κοινής Χρήσης Δεδομένων:</strong> Ενθαρρύνετε τους εκπαιδευόμενους να μοιράζονται από προεπιλογή τη μικρότερη δυνατή ποσότητα PII στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης και σε άλλους δημόσιους ιστότοπους. Τονίστε τη σημασία της αντιμετώπισης κάθε διαδικτυακής φόρμας και αιτήματος για προσωπικά στοιχεία με καχυποψία.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Βασικές Αρχές Ασφάλειας</h3>
<p><strong>Η διδασκαλία αυτών των τεχνικών αρχών είναι θεμελιώδης για την προσωπική προστασία και ανθεκτικότητα:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ισχυροί Κωδικοί Πρόσβασης και 2FA:</strong> Πρέπει να δώσουμε έμφαση στη δημιουργία μοναδικών, σύνθετων κωδικών πρόσβασης για κάθε λογαριασμό. Η χρήση του Ελέγχου Ταυτότητας Δύο Παραγόντων (2FA) — που απαιτεί ένα δεύτερο βήμα επαλήθευσης (όπως ένας κωδικός που αποστέλλεται στο τηλέφωνο) — είναι κρίσιμη, καθώς αποτρέπει τη μη εξουσιοδοτημένη πρόσβαση ακόμη και αν κλαπεί ένας κωδικός πρόσβασης.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Αναγνώριση Ασφαλών Συνδέσεων:</strong> Διδάξτε στους εκπαιδευόμενους να επαληθεύουν την ασφάλεια ενός ιστότοπου αναζητώντας το HTTPS στην αρχή της διεύθυνσης ιστού και ένα εικονίδιο λουκέτου στη γραμμή του προγράμεπειήγησης. Αυτό το απλό βήμα υποδεικνύει ότι η σύνδεση είναι κρυπτογραφημένη, καθιστώντας την ασφαλέστερη για την υποβολή ευαίσθητων δεδομένων. Οι εκπαιδευόμενοι πρέπει να κατανοήσουν ότι οι μη ασφαλείς (HTTP) ιστότοποι είναι ευάλωτοι στην υποκλοπή δεδομένων.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Θέμα 3 Ευαισθητοποίηση για το Έγκλημα στον Κυβερνοχώρο και Δεξιότητες Κριτικού Ψηφιακού Γραμματισμού</h2>
<p>Για την προστασία των ενήλικων εκπαιδευόμενων, ιδιαίτερα των ευάλωτων μεταναστών, οι εκπαιδευτικοί πρέπει να επικεντρώσουν την εκπαίδευση στην Ευαισθητοποίηση για το Έγκλημα στον Κυβερνοχώρο και στον Κριτικό Ψηφιακό Γραμματισμό. Αυτό υπερβαίνει τα απλά τεχνικά βήματα για την αντιμετώπιση της ψυχολογικής χειραγώγησης που ενυπάρχει στις διαδικτυακές απειλές.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Κατανόηση των Απειλών</h3>
<p>Οι εκπαιδευόμενοι πρέπει να μπορούν να ορίζουν κοινά εγκλήματα στον κυβερνοχώρο που σχετίζονται με την κατάστασή τους: Κλοπή Ταυτότητας, Οικονομική Απάτη και Κοινή Χρήση Εικόνων Χωρίς Συγκατάθεση, για να αναφέρουμε μερικά μόνο παραδείγματα.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Ανάπτυξη Κριτικού Ψηφιακού Γραμματισμού</h3>
<p>Ο κριτικός γραμματισμός είναι απαραίτητος για την αξιολόγηση του τεράστιου όγκου των διαδικτυακών πληροφοριών, ειδικά όταν αναζητούν βοήθεια ή εργασία.</p>
<p><strong>Οι εκπαιδευόμενοι πρέπει να εκπαιδευτούν ώστε να:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Αξιολογούν τις Διαδικτυακές Πηγές:</strong> Να αμφισβητούν την πηγή, την ημερομηνία και το κίνητρο των πληροφοριών, ειδικά εάν προκαλούν έντονη συναισθηματική αντίδραση. Διδάξτε τους να διασταυρώνουν τις ειδήσεις και τις προσφορές βοήθειας με επίσημους κυβερνητικούς ιστότοπους ή ιστότοπους μεγάλων ΜΚΟ, όχι μόνο από τα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Καταπολεμούν την Παραπληροφόρηση/Ψευδή Πληροφόρηση:</strong> Να αναγνωρίζουν ότι οι «ψευδείς ειδήσεις» (fake news) και η επιβλαβής παραπληροφόρηση συχνά έχουν σχεδιαστεί για να ενθαρρύνουν τον φόβο, τη σύγχυση ή τη δυσπιστία στα επίσημα συστήματα (όπως τα κέντρα μετανάστευσης ή οι τράπεζες).</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Αναγνώριση της Κοινωνικής Μηχανικής</h3>
<p>Ο πιο αποτελεσματικός τρόπος αποφυγής απατών είναι η αναγνώριση της κοινωνικής μηχανικής — της πράξης χειραγώγησης ανθρώπων ώστε να αποκαλύψουν εμπιστευτικές πληροφορίες. Οι πρακτικές τεχνικές περιλαμβάνουν:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Εντοπισμός του Επείγοντος και της Αυθεντίας:</strong> Οι απατεώνες δημιουργούν συχνά μια ψευδή αίσθηση επείγοντος («Ο λογαριασμός σας θα κλείσει σε 10 λεπτά!») ή υποδύονται πρόσωπα εξουσίας (διευθυντές τραπεζών, αστυνομία, κυβερνητικούς αξιωματούχους) για να παρακάμψουν την κριτική σκέψη.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Ποτέ μην κάνετε κλικ και μην καλείτε πίσω:</strong> Αντιμετωπίστε τις απροσδόκητες κλήσεις, τα κείμενα ή τα μηνύματα ηλεκτρονικού ταχυδρομείου (phishing) που ζητούν δεδομένα ή χρήματα με εξαιρετικό σκεπτικισμό. Διδάξτε τον κανόνα: Ποτέ μην κάνετε κλικ σε σύνδεσμο και μην καλείτε αριθμό που παρέχεται σε ύποπτο μήνυμα· αντίθετα, αναζητήστε ανεξάρτητα τον νόμιμο αριθμό ή ιστότοπο για επαλήθευση.</li>
</ul>

<p>Η ευθύνη του εκπαιδευτικού εκτείνεται πέρα από τη διδασκαλία συμβουλών ασφαλείας· απαιτεί τη θέσπιση ενός σαφούς, ευαίσθητου πρωτοκόλλου για παρέμβαση και υποστήριξη όταν ένας εκπαιδευόμενος αποκαλύπτει μια κυβερνοαπειλή ή απάτη. Ο άμεσος στόχος είναι να δοθεί προτεραιότητα στην ασφάλεια του εκπαιδευόμενου και να σταματήσει η βλάβη.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Πρωτόκολλα για Παρέμβαση και Υποστήριξη</h3>
<p>Όταν ένας εκπαιδευόμενος αναφέρει ένα περιστατικό, οι εκπαιδευτικοί πρέπει να υιοθετούν μια προσέγγιση βασισμένη στην κατανόηση του τραύματος (trauma-informed), εστιάζοντας πρώτα στη συναισθηματική επικύρωση και σε πρακτικά βήματα:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Πρώτα η Ασφάλεια:</strong> Αξιολογήστε εάν η απειλή περιλαμβάνει φυσικό κίνδυνο ή παρακολούθηση (stalking) στον πραγματικό κόσμο. Εάν ναι, πρέπει να γίνει άμεση επικοινωνία με τις υπηρεσίες έκτακτης ανάγκης, ακολουθώντας τα θεσμικά πρωτόκολλα.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Συλλογή Αποδεικτικών Στοιχείων:</strong> Συμβουλεύστε τον εκπαιδευόμενο να διατηρήσει όλα τα ψηφιακά αποδεικτικά στοιχεία. Αυτό σημαίνει να μην διαγράφει μηνύματα, να μην μπλοκάρει αμέσως τον δράστη (εάν αυτό σημαίνει απώλεια αποδεικτικών στοιχείων) και να βγάζει στιγμιότυπα οθόνης (screenshots) ή να κάνει βιντεοσκοπήσεις των επικοινωνιών. Αυτό είναι κρίσιμο για οποιαδήποτε πιθανή νομική ενέργεια, όπως η καταγγελία στην αστυνομία.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Πρόσθετη Υποστήριξη:</strong> Καθοδηγήστε τον εκπαιδευόμενο μέσω άμεσης τεχνικής υποστήριξης: αλλαγή κωδικών πρόσβασης σε ξεχωριστή, ασφαλή συσκευή; πάγωμα τραπεζικών λογαριασμών εάν χάθηκαν χρήματα; ή προσωρινή απενεργοποίηση του παραβιασμένου λογαριασμού στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης.</li>
</ol>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Νομική και Θεσμική Αναφορά</h3>
<p>Οι εκπαιδευτικοί πρέπει να γνωρίζουν τις επίσημες διαθέσιμες οδούς, διακρίνοντας την αναφορά στην πλατφόρμα από την αναφορά στις αρχές επιβολής του νόμου:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Αναφορά στην Πλατφόρμα:</strong> Για περιεχόμενο όπως παρενόχληση, κοινή χρήση εικόνων χωρίς συγκατάθεση ή ψεύτικα προφίλ, ο εκπαιδευτικός θα πρέπει να βοηθήσει τον εκπαιδευόμενο να χρησιμοποιήσει τα ενσωματωμένα εργαλεία αναφοράς της πλατφόρμας (π.χ. Facebook, Instagram). Αυτός είναι συχνά ο ταχύτερος τρόπος για την αφαίρεση επιβλαβούς περιεχομένου.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Θεσμική Αναφορά:</strong> Τα ιδρύματα (κολέγια, κέντρα κατάρτισης) διαθέτουν συνήθως εσωτερικούς μηχανισμούς αναφοράς περιστατικών. Αυτό είναι ζωτικής σημασίας για την αντιμετώπιση της κατάχρησης που αφορά άλλους φοιτητές, προσωπικό ή την κατάχρηση της ίδιας της εκπαιδευτικής πλατφόρμας.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Αρχές Επιβολής του Νόμου:</strong> Για εγκλήματα όπως ο εκβιασμός, η σοβαρή κλοπή ταυτότητας ή οι φυσικές απειλές, είναι απαραίτητη η αναφορά στην αστυνομία ή σε μια εθνική μονάδα δίωξης ηλεκτρονικού εγκλήματος. Ο ρόλος του εκπαιδευτικού είναι να παρέχει τις πληροφορίες και να υποστηρίζει τον εκπαιδευόμενο στη διαδικασία, η οποία μπορεί να είναι τρομακτική για τους μετανάστες που μπορεί να φοβούνται τις αρχές λόγω του καθεστώτος τους.</li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Χαρτογράφηση Πόρων και Εξωτερική Υποστήριξη</h3>
<p>Τα θύματα ψηφιακής κατάχρησης, ιδιαίτερα οι γυναίκες μετανάστριες που μπορεί επίσης να είναι επιζήσασες ενδοοικογενειακής βίας ή βίας λόγω φύλου, απαιτούν εξειδικευμένη, πολιτισμικά κατάλληλη βοήθεια. Οι εκπαιδευτικοί πρέπει να διατηρούν έναν ενημερωμένο χάρτη εξωτερικών πόρων:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Εξειδικευμένες Γραμμές Βοήθειας:</strong> Εντοπίστε εθνικές γραμμές βοήθειας για την ενδοοικογενειακή βία που προσφέρουν πολυγλωσσική υποστήριξη και κατανοούν τη διατομή της διαδικτυακής κατάχρησης και του καθεστώτος μετανάστευσης. Αναζητήστε οργανώσεις που ειδικεύονται στην υποστήριξη γυναικών από εθνοτικές μειονότητες, καθώς συχνά παρέχουν ολιστικές, πολιτισμικά προσαρμοσμένες υπηρεσίες.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Νομική Βοήθεια και Συμβουλευτική:</strong> Χαρτογραφήστε δωρεάν υπηρεσίες νομικής βοήθειας που μπορούν να συμβουλεύσουν σχετικά με εντολές ψηφιακής προστασίας, νόμους περί απορρήτου δεδομένων ή αντιμετώπιση απειλών από κακοποιούς στο εξωτερικό. Βεβαιωθείτε ότι υπάρχουν διαθέσιμες υπηρεσίες συμβουλευτικής και ψυχικής υγείας για την αντιμετώπιση του σημαντικού τραύματος που προκαλείται από την κυβερνοπαρενόχληση και την ψηφιακή παρενόχληση.</li>
