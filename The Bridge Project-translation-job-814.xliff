&lt;p&gt;The digital world can feel like a new city: full of opportunities, but also full of rules and shortcuts that aren&amp;rsquo;t always clear. For migrant women building a life in a new place, this world is part of everyday reality: from connecting with neighbours online, to applying for services, to starting work or training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR may sound like just another law, but in truth it is your map and your safety net in this city. It helps you understand which doors you can open with trust, and which ones you should approach with caution. In this unit, we look at how these rules show up in ordinary moments of life, and how knowing them can give you confidence and peace of mind as you move forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everyday Clicks and Hidden Agreements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often think of personal data as something big, like passports, bank details, or medical records. But in reality, you share personal data every time you click &amp;ldquo;Sign Up,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Book Appointment,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Create Account.&amp;rdquo; These everyday actions (enrolling in an online class, reserving a time at a government office, or even joining your local library) involve giving small but important parts of yourself away in digital form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is GDPR is there to protect you in these moments. When you register online, organisations usually ask for your name, email address, phone number, or sometimes your address. Why? Because without this information, they cannot provide the service. A library needs your name to lend you a book. A health portal needs your ID number to connect you to your doctor. These requests make sense because they are directly linked to the service you are asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But GDPR also places a limit: organisations cannot just collect more than they need. For example, a language course may need your email to send you lessons, but not your passport number. This principle is called data minimisation - only what&amp;rsquo;s necessary, nothing more. Think of it like cooking: you need salt to make soup, but you don&amp;rsquo;t need the entire salt mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For migrant women, this rule is especially important. Many services, from education to healthcare to legal support now require online registration. Knowing that the law protects you from giving away unnecessary details means you can use these services with more confidence. GDPR helps make sure that you are treated fairly, not asked for more than is reasonable, and that your personal story remains in your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sharing and Oversharing - Social Media in the Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posting in local Facebook or WhatsApp groups can feel like chatting over the garden fence: neighbourly, casual, and safe. Maybe you share a photo of homemade food, ask for advice on where to buy school supplies, or post an announcement about a cultural event. These digital spaces can indeed help you feel connected and supported in your new community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: once something is online, it rarely stays just among &amp;ldquo;neighbours.&amp;rdquo; What feels like a private chat can easily turn into public information. A photo of your child, your phone number, even your opinion about local politics: all of it becomes part of your digital identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why does it matter?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under GDPR, two important principles help us think carefully about what we post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data minimisation:&lt;/strong&gt; share only what is really needed. If you are selling a sofa, &lt;strong&gt;you don&amp;rsquo;t need to share your exact address in the first post. A private message later is safer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose limitation:&lt;/strong&gt; data should be used only for the reason you shared it. If you gave your phone number to arrange a community dinner, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t later be added to a business mailing list without your permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These principles are a way for you to protect yourself in daily life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-1.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a Post Travels Further Than You Planned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we post online, we usually imagine that our words or pictures will stay right where we put them: in the friendly Facebook parents&amp;rsquo; group, in the WhatsApp chat with neighbours, or in the community forum we trust. But the reality is different: once something is online, it can travel much further than we planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a simple example: you share a picture of your child&amp;rsquo;s birthday party in a parents&amp;rsquo; group. You just want to show the beautiful cake you baked. One member saves the photo and sends it to a cousin, who shares it again. Within a few clicks, the image has left your safe circle. Now strangers who have never met can see your living room, your child&amp;rsquo;s face, maybe even the street outside your window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe you post your address in a local forum because you want to sell a stroller. A neighbour shows up to buy it, but a week later a stranger knocks on your door too, saying &amp;ldquo;they found the post online.&amp;rdquo; Suddenly, a piece of information that felt private is no longer under your control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many migrant women, social media is more than entertainment &amp;ndash; it is a practical tool for life. Local groups help find affordable housing, jobs, or advice on school registration and healthcare. But this usefulness also comes with risk. A woman who posts her phone number and address for a babysitter offer may be contacted by a scammer asking for passport copies. A mother who proudly shares photos of her children may not realise that children&amp;rsquo;s images are considered sensitive personal data and are given special protection under GDPR. Or someone looking for work in a community group might end up receiving calls they never wanted, simply because they shared a number publicly instead of asking for private messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these examples show one simple truth: digital information moves fast, and it is hard to control once released. That is why earlier mentioned GDPR&amp;rsquo;s ideas of data minimisation &amp;ndash; sharing only what&amp;rsquo;s necessary, and purpose limitation &amp;ndash; ensuring that data is used only for the reason you gave it, are so useful in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to check yourself before posting is to pause and ask: Would I feel comfortable if this information was seen by people I don&amp;rsquo;t know? If the answer is no, then it may be better to keep the details private or share them in a more secure way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting information online does not mean isolating yourself. Social media can be a powerful tool to connect, learn, and build a new life. But it works best when you stay in control of what you share. Think of your digital data as a set of house keys: you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t give them to just anyone, so don&amp;rsquo;t hand out your digital keys too easily either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if you&amp;rsquo;re wondering whether it&amp;rsquo;s still safe to share cat pictures &amp;ndash; yes. Cats run the internet anyway.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GDPR and Everyday Bureaucracy: Using Government Websites with Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to government services, almost everything is digital now. Applying for a residence permit, booking a medical appointment, registering your child for school, or even applying for housing support often happens online. This means that you are constantly entering your most sensitive personal data into digital systems: names, addresses, ID numbers, family details, sometimes even financial or medical information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that GDPR sets strict rules for how authorities and public offices must handle this data. Unlike a social media company that uses your clicks for advertising, a government office can only process your data for a legal purpose: to provide the service you requested. This is called lawful basis for processing. For example, when you enter your ID number to book a residence permit appointment, the office is not asking for &amp;ldquo;consent&amp;rdquo; in the same way as a private company might. Instead, they are processing your data because it is required by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, GDPR gives you rights here too. The office must collect only what is necessary (again, data minimisation). If you are applying for childcare support, they can ask about your children &amp;mdash; but they cannot suddenly demand your full medical history. They must also keep your data secure, usually by encrypting it and limiting who inside the office can see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important rule is transparency. Government websites should explain clearly what happens to the data you provide, how long it will be stored, and who may access it. Sometimes this information is written in complicated language, but the principle is simple: you should not be left in the dark. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand, you have the right to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-2.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;GDPR and Everyday Bureaucracy: Using Government&amp;nbsp;Websites with Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For migrant women, this can feel intimidating: forms in another language, official letters that look very serious, and the pressure of needing the service. But GDPR means you don&amp;rsquo;t have to give away more than is necessary. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When booking an appointment online, the system may ask for your email and phone number to confirm the date. That&amp;rsquo;s reasonable. But if a website suddenly asks for your partner&amp;rsquo;s passport details just to make the booking, that would raise questions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When applying for financial support, you may need to upload income documents. But the office must store them securely and not keep them forever &amp;ndash; only as long as legally required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These protections matter because they build trust. Migrant women often depend on these services at crucial moments in life. Knowing that there is a legal framework protecting your data helps shift the feeling from &amp;ldquo;I am giving away too much&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;I am exercising my right to services in a safe way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time you are filling in an online form for a government service, remember: GDPR is working quietly in the background, making sure that your personal information is treated with respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-4.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 4" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At Work and in Training - Your Rights as an Employee or Student&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting a new job or attending a training course is an exciting step. But it also usually means handing over a lot of personal information. Employers and training providers may ask for copies of your ID, your bank account details so they can pay you, medical certificates, or diplomas. Sometimes they use digital platforms where you are asked to upload documents yourself. All of this is personal data, and GDPR makes sure it is handled with care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employer or school does have the right to collect some of this information. They need your ID to confirm your legal right to work or study, your bank details to pay your salary, and sometimes health certificates if the job involves food handling or childcare. Under GDPR this is called a lawful basis for processing: they are allowed to collect the data because it is necessary for a legal or contractual reason, not because you &amp;ldquo;consent.&amp;rdquo; But lawful does not mean unlimited. A cleaning company can ask for your work permit, but they cannot demand details about your religion or political beliefs. A training school may need your contact information to register you, but not the names of all your family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is important to remember is that GDPR gives you the right to see what your employer or training provider stores about you, and if something is wrong you can demand a correction. If data is no longer needed, for example, a passport copy kept years after you finished a training course, you can request that it be deleted. In some situations you also have the right to object to certain uses of your information, such as being signed up for marketing emails without asking. These rights are there to stop unnecessary or excessive use of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;At Work and in Training - Your Rights as an Employee or Student&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday situations make these rules very real. Imagine starting a new job in a restaurant: the manager asks for your ID and bank details to prepare your contract. That is legitimate. But if he also asks for your husband&amp;rsquo;s passport details &amp;ldquo;just in case,&amp;rdquo; that would not be allowed under GDPR. Or think about providing a doctor&amp;rsquo;s note for sick leave. This counts as sensitive data and must be handled carefully. Only authorised staff should see it; it should never be left lying on a counter where anyone can read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is online training platforms: you may upload a diploma to join a course. The provider can store it while you are studying, but once the course ends they should not keep it indefinitely. They also must protect it properly so that not every staff member can casually browse through student files. Even workplace monitoring is regulated. Cameras at the entrance of a shop for security are usually acceptable, but a hidden camera in the staff room would clearly violate GDPR rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many migrant women, jobs and training opportunities are key steps toward independence. But the fear of losing work or missing a course can make it difficult to question what information is being collected. GDPR exists to balance this power: it states clearly that you do not lose your data rights when you become an employee or student. You can ask questions such as: how long will you keep this document, who has access to this file, or can I have a copy of the data you hold about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workplaces and schools may need some of your data, but GDPR ensures they do not get to treat you like an open book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 5" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-5.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 5" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[h5p id="8"]&lt;/p&gt;</source><target>&lt;h2&gt;Вступ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Цифровий світ може здаватися новим містом: сповненим можливостей, але також і правилами та короткими шляхами, які не завжди зрозумілі. Для жінок-мігранток, які будують життя на новому місці, цей світ є частиною повсякденної реальності: від спілкування з сусідами онлайн до подання заяв на послуги, початку роботи чи навчання.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR може звучати як ще один закон, але насправді це ваша карта і ваша страховка у цьому місті. Він допомагає зрозуміти, які двері можна відчиняти з довірою, а до яких варто ставитися обережно. У цьому розділі ми розглянемо, як ці правила проявляються у звичайних життєвих ситуаціях, і як знання їх може дати вам впевненість і спокій, коли ви рухаєтеся вперед.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Повсякденні кліки та приховані угоди&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ми часто думаємо про персональні дані як про щось велике: паспорти, банківські реквізити чи медичні записи. Але насправді ви ділитеся персональними даними щоразу, коли натискаєте «Зареєструватися», «Записатися на прийом» чи «Створити акаунт». Ці повсякденні дії (запис на онлайн-курс, бронювання часу в державній установі чи навіть вступ до місцевої бібліотеки) означають передачу невеликих, але важливих частин себе у цифровій формі.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Добра новина в тому, що GDPR захищає вас у ці моменти. Коли ви реєструєтеся онлайн, організації зазвичай просять ваше ім’я, електронну адресу, номер телефону або іноді адресу. Чому? Бо без цієї інформації вони не можуть надати послугу. Бібліотеці потрібне ваше ім’я, щоб видати вам книгу. Медичному порталу потрібен ваш ідентифікаційний номер, щоб зв’язати вас із лікарем. Ці запити логічні, бо вони безпосередньо пов’язані з послугою, яку ви замовляєте.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Але GDPR також встановлює обмеження: організації не можуть збирати більше, ніж потрібно. Наприклад, мовному курсу потрібна ваша електронна адреса для надсилання уроків, але не номер паспорта. Цей принцип називається мінімізацією даних — лише необхідне, нічого зайвого. Уявіть це як приготування супу: вам потрібна сіль, але не вся соляна шахта.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для жінок-мігранток це правило особливо важливе. Багато послуг — від освіти до медицини чи юридичної підтримки — тепер вимагають онлайн-реєстрації. Знання, що закон захищає вас від передачі зайвих даних, дозволяє користуватися цими послугами впевненіше. GDPR допомагає гарантувати, що з вами поводяться справедливо, не вимагають більше, ніж розумно, і ваша особиста історія залишається під вашим контролем.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ділення і надмірне ділення — соціальні мережі у громаді&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Публікації у місцевих групах Facebook чи WhatsApp можуть здаватися розмовою через паркан: по-сусідськи, невимушено і безпечно. Можливо, ви ділитеся фото домашньої їжі, питаєте поради, де купити шкільне приладдя, чи публікуєте оголошення про культурну подію. Ці цифрові простори справді можуть допомогти відчути підтримку і зв’язок у новій громаді.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Але ось у чому справа: як тільки щось потрапляє онлайн, воно рідко залишається лише серед «сусідів». Те, що здається приватною розмовою, легко може стати публічною інформацією. Фото вашої дитини, номер телефону, навіть ваша думка про місцеву політику — усе це стає частиною вашої цифрової ідентичності.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Але чому це важливо?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Згідно з GDPR, два важливі принципи допомагають нам обдумано ставитися до того, що ми публікуємо:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Мінімізація даних:&lt;/strong&gt; діліться лише тим, що справді потрібно. Якщо ви продаєте диван, &lt;strong&gt;не потрібно одразу вказувати точну адресу. Приватне повідомлення пізніше — безпечніше.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Обмеження мети:&lt;/strong&gt; дані мають використовуватися лише з тією метою, для якої ви їх надали. Якщо ви дали номер телефону для організації спільної вечері, його не мають додавати до бізнес-розсилки без вашої згоди.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ці принципи — спосіб захистити себе у повсякденному житті.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-1.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Коли пост поширюється далі, ніж ви планували&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Коли ми публікуємо щось онлайн, зазвичай уявляємо, що наші слова чи фото залишаться там, де ми їх розмістили: у дружній батьківській групі Facebook, у чаті WhatsApp із сусідами чи на форумі громади, якій довіряємо. Але реальність інша: як тільки щось потрапляє онлайн, воно може поширитися набагато далі, ніж ми планували.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Уявіть простий приклад: ви ділитеся фото з дня народження дитини у батьківській групі. Ви просто хочете показати гарний торт, який спекли. Один із учасників зберігає фото і надсилає його кузену, а той — ще комусь. За кілька кліків зображення залишає ваше безпечне коло. Тепер незнайомці можуть бачити вашу вітальню, обличчя дитини, можливо, навіть вулицю за вікном.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Або ви публікуєте адресу на місцевому форумі, бо хочете продати коляску. Сусід приходить купити її, але через тиждень до вас стукає незнайомець, кажучи, що «знайшов пост онлайн». Раптом інформація, яка здавалася приватною, вже не під вашим контролем.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для багатьох жінок-мігранток соціальні мережі — це не лише розвага, а й практичний інструмент. Місцеві групи допомагають знайти доступне житло, роботу чи поради щодо школи і медицини. Але ця користь має і ризики. Жінка, яка публікує номер телефону й адресу для пропозиції няні, може отримати дзвінок від шахрая, який просить копію паспорта. Мати, яка з гордістю ділиться фото дітей, може не знати, що зображення дітей вважаються чутливими персональними даними і мають особливий захист за GDPR. Або хтось, хто шукає роботу у групі, може отримати небажані дзвінки, просто тому що поділився номером публічно, а не попросив написати у приват.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Усі ці приклади показують просту істину: цифрова інформація поширюється швидко, і контролювати її складно. Саме тому згадані раніше принципи GDPR — мінімізація даних (ділитися лише необхідним) і обмеження мети (використання даних лише з тією метою, для якої ви їх надали) — такі корисні у повсякденному житті.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Найпростіший спосіб перевірити себе перед публікацією — зупинитися і спитати: Чи буде мені комфортно, якщо цю інформацію побачать незнайомі люди? Якщо ні, краще залишити деталі приватними або поділитися ними більш безпечним способом.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Захист інформації онлайн не означає ізоляцію. Соціальні мережі можуть бути потужним інструментом для спілкування, навчання і побудови нового життя. Але вони працюють найкраще, коли ви контролюєте, чим ділитеся. Думайте про свої цифрові дані як про набір ключів від дому: ви не віддаєте їх будь-кому, тож не роздавайте свої цифрові ключі надто легко.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(І якщо ви питаєте, чи безпечно досі ділитися фото котів — так. Коти все одно керують інтернетом.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GDPR і повсякденна бюрократія: користування державними сайтами з упевненістю&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Щодо державних послуг, майже все зараз відбувається онлайн. Подання на дозвіл на проживання, запис до лікаря, реєстрація дитини до школи чи навіть заявка на житлову допомогу часто відбуваються через інтернет. Це означає, що ви постійно вводите свої найчутливіші персональні дані у цифрові системи: імена, адреси, ідентифікаційні номери, сімейні дані, іноді навіть фінансову чи медичну інформацію.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Добра новина — GDPR встановлює суворі правила для того, як органи влади та державні установи мають поводитися з цими даними. На відміну від компанії соціальних мереж, яка використовує ваші кліки для реклами, державна установа може обробляти ваші дані лише з юридичною метою: для надання послуги, яку ви замовили. Це називається законною підставою для обробки. Наприклад, коли ви вводите ідентифікаційний номер для запису на прийом щодо дозволу на проживання, установа не просить «згоду» так, як це робить приватна компанія. Вони обробляють ваші дані, бо це вимагає закон.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Втім, GDPR дає вам права і тут. Установа має збирати лише необхідне (знову ж, мінімізація даних). Якщо ви подаєте заявку на допомогу по догляду за дитиною, вони можуть питати про дітей — але не можуть раптово вимагати вашу повну медичну історію. Вони також мають зберігати ваші дані у безпеці, зазвичай шифруючи їх і обмежуючи доступ лише уповноваженим працівникам.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ще одне важливе правило — прозорість. Державні сайти мають чітко пояснювати, що відбувається з вашими даними, як довго вони зберігаються і хто може мати до них доступ. Іноді ця інформація написана складною мовою, але принцип простий: ви не маєте залишатися у невіданні. Якщо ви не розумієте, ви маєте право запитати.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-2.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;GDPR і повсякденна бюрократія: користування державними сайтами з упевненістю&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для жінок-мігранток це може здаватися лякаючим: форми іншою мовою, офіційні листи, що виглядають дуже серйозно, і тиск через необхідність отримати послугу. Але GDPR означає, що ви не повинні надавати більше, ніж потрібно. Наприклад:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Під час онлайн-бронювання система може попросити вашу електронну адресу і номер телефону для підтвердження дати. Це розумно. Але якщо сайт раптом просить паспортні дані вашого партнера лише для бронювання — це викликає питання.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Під час подання на фінансову допомогу, можливо, потрібно завантажити документи про доходи. Але установа має зберігати їх безпечно і не зберігати їх вічно — лише стільки, скільки вимагає закон.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ці захисти важливі, бо вони створюють довіру. Жінки-мігрантки часто залежать від цих послуг у вирішальні моменти життя. Знання, що існує правова база для захисту ваших даних, допомагає змінити відчуття з «я віддаю занадто багато» на «я користуюся своїм правом на послуги безпечно».&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Тож наступного разу, коли ви заповнюєте онлайн-форму для державної послуги, пам’ятайте: GDPR працює тихо у фоновому режимі, забезпечуючи повагу до вашої особистої інформації.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-4.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 4" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;На роботі та на навчанні — ваші права як працівниці чи студентки&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Початок нової роботи чи навчального курсу — це захопливий крок. Але це також зазвичай означає передачу великої кількості особистої інформації. Роботодавці та навчальні заклади можуть просити копії вашого посвідчення особи, банківські реквізити для виплати зарплати, медичні довідки чи дипломи. Іноді використовуються цифрові платформи, де ви самі завантажуєте документи. Усе це — персональні дані, і GDPR гарантує їхню обережну обробку.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Роботодавець чи навчальний заклад має право збирати частину цієї інформації. Їм потрібен ваш документ для підтвердження права на роботу чи навчання, банківські реквізити для виплати зарплати, іноді медичні довідки, якщо робота пов’язана з харчуванням чи доглядом за дітьми. За GDPR це називається законною підставою для обробки: вони можуть збирати дані, бо це потрібно за законом чи контрактом, а не тому, що ви «даєте згоду». Але законність не означає безмежність. Клінінгова компанія може просити дозвіл на роботу, але не має права вимагати інформацію про вашу релігію чи політичні погляди. Навчальний заклад може потребувати ваші контактні дані для реєстрації, але не імена всіх членів вашої родини.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Важливо пам’ятати, що GDPR дає вам право бачити, які дані про вас зберігає роботодавець чи навчальний заклад, і якщо щось невірно — вимагати виправлення. Якщо дані більше не потрібні, наприклад, копія паспорта зберігається роками після завершення курсу, ви можете вимагати її видалення. У деяких випадках ви також маєте право заперечити проти певного використання ваших даних, наприклад, якщо вас підписали на маркетингові розсилки без вашої згоди. Ці права існують, щоб запобігти зайвому чи надмірному використанню ваших даних.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;На роботі та на навчанні — ваші права як працівниці чи студентки&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Повсякденні ситуації роблять ці правила дуже реальними. Уявіть, що ви починаєте нову роботу в ресторані: менеджер просить ваш документ і банківські реквізити для підготовки контракту. Це законно. Але якщо він також просить паспортні дані вашого чоловіка «про всяк випадок» — це вже не дозволено за GDPR. Або, наприклад, ви надаєте лікарняний для відпустки через хворобу. Це чутливі дані, і з ними треба поводитися обережно. Лише уповноважені працівники мають їх бачити; їх не можна залишати на стійці, де їх може побачити будь-хто.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ще один приклад — онлайн-платформи для навчання: ви можете завантажити диплом для вступу на курс. Провайдер може зберігати його, поки ви навчаєтеся, але після завершення курсу не повинен зберігати його безстроково. Також він має захищати його належним чином, щоб не кожен працівник міг переглядати студентські файли. Навіть відеоспостереження на роботі регулюється. Камери на вході до магазину для безпеки зазвичай прийнятні, але прихована камера у кімнаті персоналу — явне порушення правил GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Для багатьох жінок-мігранток робота і навчання — ключові кроки до незалежності. Але страх втратити роботу чи пропустити курс може ускладнювати питання про те, які дані збирають. GDPR існує, щоб збалансувати цю владу: він чітко говорить, що ви не втрачаєте права на свої дані, ставши працівницею чи студенткою. Ви можете питати: як довго зберігатимуть цей документ, хто має доступ до цього файлу, чи можу я отримати копію даних, які ви про мене зберігаєте?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Робочі місця і навчальні заклади можуть потребувати частину ваших даних, але GDPR гарантує, що вас не будуть розглядати як відкриту книгу.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 5" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-5.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 5" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Гейміфікаційна активність&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Назва активності: Діалогові картки&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Завдання:&lt;/strong&gt; Натискайте на кожну картку, щоб дослідити реальні ситуації щодо онлайн-безпеки та приватності. Прочитайте питання на&amp;nbsp;лицьовій стороні, подумайте над відповіддю, потім переверніть картку, щоб побачити пояснення та&amp;nbsp;дізнатися, як GDPR захищає ваші персональні дані.&lt;/p&gt;
