&lt;p&gt;Now that you've taken your first steps on the road to digital safety, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get to know someone you might not have officially met yet - your digital self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you sign up for an account, post a photo, click on an ad, or even just browse for dinner recipes at midnight (no judgment), you leave behind small pieces of information. Over time, these pieces form your digital identity, a kind of online version of you, built from data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this module, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore what that identity is made of, how it&amp;rsquo;s used (and sometimes misused), and why it matters more than you might think. We&amp;rsquo;ll also look at how your digital footprint, everything you leave behind online, can shape your opportunities, your privacy, and even your reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Digital Identity?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the Unit 2 introduces the concept of digital identity - the unique collection of data points that represent a person in the online world. Think of it as your virtual fingerprint, made up of everything from your name and birthdate to your favourite online shop, the way you scroll through news articles, and even when you tend to check your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data points include obvious items like your email address, phone number, and profile photo, but also less visible details: your browser search history (once considered anonymous), device information, location data, and behavioural patterns, such as when you like to shop online, which types of ads you click, or whether you're a night owl or an early bird based on your app activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a passport, your digital identity isn&amp;rsquo;t issued to you in one neat package. Instead, it&amp;rsquo;s built over time, piece by piece, as you move through your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider common activities: signing up for Netflix, participating in online learning, or using Google Maps. When registering for Netflix, users share their name, email, payment details, and often, viewing habits. Each small action adds another brushstroke to the digital portrait of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, your digital identity is like a shadow version of yourself that follows you from platform to platform, collecting bits of information along the way. And depending on how it&amp;rsquo;s managed, it can either open doors or cause unintended trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legally speaking, the General Data Protection Regulation says that most of the information forming your digital identity is considered personal data. In simple terms, this means that if a piece of information can be used to identify you, it falls under GDPR protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes obvious things like your name or ID number, but also less obvious details such as your IP address, location data, or even your preferences based on how you use certain websites or apps. Even if one data point alone doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal your full identity, it might when combined with others, and that&amp;rsquo;s enough for the GDPR to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulation has prompted organizations to develop more robust digital identity management systems and offer users rights such as access, rectification, and erasure. This is reflected in GDPR enforcement cases: in 2023, Meta (Facebook) was fined &amp;euro;1.2 billion for transferring EU users&amp;rsquo; personal data to the US in violation of GDPR rules, highlighting the real-world implications of managing digital identities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉 &lt;a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Source: 1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board. (n.d.)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if the data can be linked back to you, then it&amp;rsquo;s protected, and you have rights over how it&amp;rsquo;s collected, stored, and used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Digital Identity Is Used (and Misused)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital identity, built through social media accounts, online banking profiles, and government-issued IDs, acts as a central credential that unlocks access to platforms, services, and civic participation. In 2025, Juniper Research projected that digital identity verification checks would reach 86 billion, underscoring its ubiquity in situations like logging into apps and bank accounts to accessing healthcare and public services. (Source: The power and promise of digital identity. (n.d.). DXC Technology. &lt;a href="https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond simply logging you in, your digital identity also fuels personalised experiences, like when Spotify magically knows you need a 80s throwback playlist on a Monday morning, or when an online shop seems to read your mind and suggests exactly what you didn&amp;rsquo;t know you needed. These tailored touches are convenient, but they rely on collecting and analysing a lot of your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that while most people (around 63%) enjoy getting personalised content, more than half also expect something in return, like stronger privacy and security. Fair enough, right? But behind the scenes, this data is often used to power advertising systems that are far more interested in selling than serenading you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Source: Wendel, S. (2024, July 2). Digital Identity: Finding the balance between personalization and security. Experian Insights. &lt;a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/digital-identity-finding-the-balance-between-personalization-and-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/digital-identity-finding-the-balance-between-personalization-and-security&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But relying so heavily on personal profiles comes with risks. For starters, there&amp;rsquo;s the obvious, like someone pretending to be you online, stealing your identity, or your data being leaked in a breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say that your data could be &amp;ldquo;leaked in a breach,&amp;rdquo; we mean that information about you, like your name, email, password, or even bank details might end up in the wrong hands because a company or platform didn&amp;rsquo;t protect it properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a website you&amp;rsquo;ve used gets hacked. The attackers break into its systems and steal user data stored there. If you had an account on that site, your information might be part of what&amp;rsquo;s stolen - this is what we call a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why tools like multi-factor authentication (yes, those annoying codes sent to your phone) and biometric logins (like fingerprints or face recognition) are more important than ever. They may seem like small steps, but they&amp;rsquo;re big shields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-2.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also risks that are harder to see. Many websites and apps use algorithms, basically sets of rules written by programmers, to make decisions about people automatically. These systems look at your data and try to predict things about you: how reliable you are, what you might buy, or even what kind of job or loan you &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if an algorithm decides you&amp;rsquo;re not a good match for a job based on your online activity or profile, you might never even know you were screened out. The same can happen with loans, insurance prices, or which political messages you see online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR establishes a critical legal framework to protect users in the European Union. Under GDPR, personal data use must be lawful, transparent, and purpose-limited. Consent must be specific, informed, and freely given, (No vague &amp;ldquo;we might use your data for marketing&amp;hellip; or something.&amp;rdquo;) with individuals retaining the rights to withdraw consent, access and correct data, and to object to certain forms of profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen those pop-ups on websites that say things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This website uses cookies to enhance your experience. Accept?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accept All / Accept only necessary cookies/ Let me read 16 pages of legal terms.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s GDPR in action: asking for your permission (though, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, websites do love making the &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Accept All&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; button the biggest one on the screen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, importantly, GDPR&amp;rsquo;s Article 22 states that people cannot be subject solely to automated decision-making, including profiling, when such decisions have legal or significant effects on them. Whenever automated systems are used for decisions, individuals must be able to request human intervention and challenge the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Rights related to automated decision making including profiling. &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is your Digital Footprint Made Of?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen how your digital identity can be used to personalise your experience (or steer you in ways you didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for) it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at where all that data comes from in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer lies in your Digital footprint: the collection of data you leave behind every time you use the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This footprint is made up of everything you do online, and it comes in two main flavours: what you share on purpose, and what gets collected quietly in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is called your active digital footprint. Those are the things you choose to put out there: the Instagram photos you post, the job titles you list on LinkedIn, the product reviews you leave on Amazon, or the time you signed up for that newsletter you never quite got around to reading. Every time you click &amp;ldquo;submit,&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re adding another piece to the puzzle of your online self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s your passive digital footprint, which is a bit sneakier. This includes all the data that&amp;rsquo;s gathered about you without you typing a single word. Websites log your browsing habits, cookies track what you click, and your phone might be sharing your location with apps you forgot you even downloaded. Even something as simple as uploading a photo can carry extra data, like where and when it was taken, tucked away in the file&amp;rsquo;s metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 3" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-3.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 3" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 15px"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Bitdefender.

&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why It Matters: Reputation, Safety, and Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Digital Footprints and Reputation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen how digital identities are shaped, tracked, and used: sometimes for convenience, sometimes for commercial gain, and sometimes in ways that are far less transparent. But beyond the technical mechanics lies the heart of the issue: your digital footprint is not just data. It&amp;rsquo;s reputation, it&amp;rsquo;s opportunity, it&amp;rsquo;s safety, and it&amp;rsquo;s personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every action online leaves a trace. Over time, these traces form a portrait of who you are, at least as far as digital systems, companies, and even other people are concerned. That portrait can influence how others view you, from potential employers to public officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many hiring processes now involve quiet online searches: reviewing social media profiles, scanning old comments, or evaluating what kind of digital presence a person maintains. According to 2025 research, 70% of employers screen candidates online, with 54% admitting they have eliminated prospects based on social media feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Source: Javed, A. (2025, June 5). 15+ social media recruitment Statistics You have to know. Qureos Hiring Guide. &lt;a href="https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inappropriate posts, inflammatory language, unprofessional content, even consistent spelling mistakes: these things can send subtle (or not so subtle) signals to a future employer. And while it may feel unfair, the truth is that people have lost job offers, or even employment, because of something they once posted online, sometimes years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes all of this even more complex is that much of the data collection happens in the background. You don&amp;rsquo;t see it, you don&amp;rsquo;t approve it actively each time, and yet it accumulates, quietly building a profile of your preferences, behaviours, and relationships. This information can be used to show you personalised ads, news stories, political content, or special offers. But it can also be sold, analysed, or even manipulated by companies, political groups, and in the worst cases, cybercriminals or abusive individuals using digital tools to track, harass, or exploit others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-4.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 4" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why It Matters: Safety and Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in the European Union, the GDPR offers one of the strongest legal frameworks in the world to protect individuals&amp;rsquo; personal data. Far more than a formality or an abstract right, the GDPR is a powerful tool that places individuals, not corporations or platforms, at the centre of digital decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the beginning of this Module, under GDPR, you are entitled to know what data is being collected about you, by whom, and for what reason. This is known as the &lt;em&gt;right to be informed&lt;/em&gt;, and it is the reason you see cookie banners, privacy policies, and consent boxes when visiting websites. You also have the &lt;em&gt;right of access&lt;/em&gt;, meaning you can request a copy of the personal data any company or public institution holds about you, free of charge and without needing to justify the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, you may request a correction (&lt;em&gt;right to rectification&lt;/em&gt;). If it is no longer necessary, or was collected without proper legal basis, you can ask for it to be deleted (&lt;em&gt;right to erasure, also known as the &amp;ldquo;right to be forgotten&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, such as automated decision-making or behavioural profiling, you can object to how your data is being used, especially when it impacts your opportunities, such as access to services, employment, or housing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these rights are not merely theoretical. Every organisation operating in the EU (or targeting EU residents) must provide clear instructions for how you can exercise them. For example, you can write a simple email requesting deletion of your data, and the company is legally required to respond, often within one month. This legal obligation is emphasized in the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) initiative by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which audits how companies comply with the right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR across all 32 EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Source: CEF 2025: Launch of coordinated enforcement on the right to erasure | European Data Protection Board. (n.d.). &lt;a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a company fails to comply or ignores your deletion request, you have the right to escalate the matter. You can file a complaint with your national Data Protection Authority, which has the power to investigate and impose penalties for non-compliance. The 2025 enforcement focus by DPAs is particularly rigorous, requiring companies to demonstrate they have clear and efficient processes to remove all user data, including backups, unless lawful exceptions apply (such as legal retention obligations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gamification Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity Title: Drag and Drop&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Tiles below the image describe a type of digital data you leave behind. Your task is to drag and drop&amp;nbsp;each item into the correct category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passive Digital Footprint&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; information collected about you without you actively giving it (like&lt;br&gt;browsing history or device info)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active Digital Footprint&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; information you share or create yourself (like posts or messages)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[h5p id="7"]&lt;/p&gt;</source><target>&lt;h2&gt;Вступ&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Тепер, коли ви зробили перші кроки на шляху до цифрової безпеки, настав час познайомитися з кимось, з ким ви, можливо, ще офіційно не зустрічалися — з вашим цифровим «я».&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Щоразу, коли ви реєструєте обліковий запис, публікуєте фото, клікаєте на рекламу або навіть просто шукаєте рецепти вечері опівночі (без осуду), ви залишаєте за собою маленькі шматочки інформації. З часом ці шматочки формують вашу цифрову ідентичність — своєрідну онлайн-версію вас, створену з даних.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;У цьому модулі ми дослідимо, з чого складається ця ідентичність, як її використовують (а іноді й зловживають), і чому вона важливіша, ніж ви могли б подумати. Ми також розглянемо, як ваш цифровий слід — усе, що ви залишаєте в інтернеті — може впливати на ваші можливості, приватність і навіть репутацію.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Що таке цифрова ідентичність?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ця частина Модуля 2 знайомить із поняттям цифрової ідентичності — унікальної сукупності даних, які представляють людину у світі онлайн. Уявіть це як ваш віртуальний відбиток пальця, що складається з усього: від імені та дати народження до улюбленого онлайн-магазину, способу прокручування новин і навіть часу, коли ви зазвичай перевіряєте телефон.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ці дані включають очевидні речі, як-от вашу електронну адресу, номер телефону та фото профілю, але й менш помітні деталі: історію пошуку в браузері (яка колись вважалася анонімною), інформацію про пристрій, дані про місцезнаходження та поведінкові патерни, наприклад, коли ви любите робити покупки онлайн, на яку рекламу клікаєте чи чи ви «сова» або «жайворонок» за активністю в додатках.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;На відміну від паспорта, вашу цифрову ідентичність не видають вам у готовому вигляді. Вона формується поступово, крок за кроком, у міру того, як ви проживаєте свій день.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Згадайте звичні дії: реєстрація в Netflix, участь в онлайн-навчанні чи використання Google Maps. Під час реєстрації в Netflix користувачі діляться іменем, електронною адресою, платіжними даними та часто — звичками перегляду. Кожна маленька дія додає ще один штрих до цифрового портрета &lt;em&gt;вас&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;У певному сенсі, ваша цифрова ідентичність — це тіньова версія вас, яка слідує за вами від платформи до платформи, збираючи шматочки інформації на шляху. І залежно від того, як нею керують, вона може або відчиняти двері, або створювати несподівані проблеми.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;З юридичної точки зору, Загальний регламент захисту даних (GDPR) визначає, що більшість інформації, яка формує вашу цифрову ідентичність, вважається персональними даними. Простими словами, якщо інформацію можна використати для ідентифікації вас, вона підпадає під захист GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Це стосується очевидних речей, як-от ваше ім’я чи номер посвідчення, але й менш очевидних деталей, таких як IP-адреса, дані про місцезнаходження чи навіть ваші вподобання, засновані на тому, як ви користуєтеся певними сайтами чи додатками. Навіть якщо одна точка даних сама по собі не розкриває вашу повну ідентичність, у поєднанні з іншими — цього достатньо, щоб GDPR застосовувався.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Регламент змусив організації розробити більш надійні системи управління цифровою ідентичністю та надати користувачам права на доступ, виправлення та видалення даних. Це відображено у випадках застосування GDPR: у 2023 році Meta (Facebook) була оштрафована на 1,2 мільярда євро за передачу персональних даних користувачів ЄС до США з порушенням правил GDPR, що підкреслює реальні наслідки управління цифровими ідентичностями.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;👉 &lt;a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Джерело: Штраф у 1,2 мільярда євро для Facebook внаслідок обов’язкового рішення EDPB | Європейська рада із захисту даних. (н.д.)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Отже, якщо дані можна пов’язати з вами, вони захищені, і ви маєте права щодо того, як їх збирають, зберігають і використовують.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Як використовують (і зловживають) цифрову ідентичність&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Цифрова ідентичність, створена через акаунти в соцмережах, профілі онлайн-банкінгу та державні посвідчення, виступає центральним обліковим записом, що відкриває доступ до платформ, сервісів і громадської участі. У 2025 році Juniper Research прогнозувала, що перевірок цифрової ідентичності буде 86 мільярдів, що підкреслює її всюдисущість у ситуаціях — від входу в додатки та банківські акаунти до доступу до медичних і державних послуг. (Джерело: The power and promise of digital identity. (н.д.). DXC Technology. &lt;a href="https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Окрім простого входу, ваша цифрова ідентичність також забезпечує персоналізований досвід, наприклад, коли Spotify «чарівним чином» знає, що вам потрібен плейлист із хітами 80-х у понеділок вранці, або коли онлайн-магазин ніби читає ваші думки й пропонує саме те, про що ви навіть не здогадувалися. Ці персоналізовані моменти зручні, але вони залежать від збору й аналізу великої кількості ваших даних.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Опитування показують, що хоча більшості людей (близько 63%) подобається отримувати персоналізований контент, понад половина також очікує щось натомість, наприклад, посилену приватність і безпеку. Логічно, правда? Але за лаштунками ці дані часто використовують для рекламних систем, які набагато більше зацікавлені у продажах, ніж у тому, щоб вас розважати.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Але така велика залежність від персональних профілів несе ризики. По-перше, це очевидне: хтось може видавати себе за вас онлайн, вкрасти вашу ідентичність або ваші дані можуть потрапити у витік.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Коли ми кажемо, що ваші дані можуть бути «злиті у витоку», ми маємо на увазі, що інформація про вас, як-от ім’я, електронна пошта, пароль чи навіть банківські дані, може потрапити не в ті руки через те, що компанія чи платформа не захистила їх належним чином.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Уявіть, що сайт, яким ви користувалися, зламали. Зловмисники проникають у його системи й крадуть дані користувачів, що там зберігаються. Якщо у вас був акаунт на цьому сайті, ваша інформація може бути серед викраденого — це і є витік даних.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ось чому інструменти на кшталт багатофакторної автентифікації (так, ті дратівливі коди на телефон) і біометричних входів (відбитки пальців чи розпізнавання обличчя) важливі як ніколи. Вони можуть здаватися дрібницями, але це великі щити.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-2.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 2" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Є й ризики, які важче помітити. Багато сайтів і додатків використовують алгоритми — по суті, набори правил, написаних програмістами — для автоматичного прийняття рішень щодо людей. Ці системи аналізують ваші дані й намагаються передбачити щось про вас: наскільки ви надійні, що можете купити, або навіть яку роботу чи кредит ви «повинні» отримати.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Наприклад, якщо алгоритм вирішить, що ви не підходите для роботи на основі вашої онлайн-активності чи профілю, ви можете навіть не дізнатися, що вас відсіяли. Те саме може стосуватися кредитів, цін на страхування чи політичних повідомлень, які ви бачите онлайн.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDPR встановлює критичну правову основу для захисту користувачів у Європейському Союзі. За GDPR використання персональних даних має бути законним, прозорим і обмеженим метою. Згода має бути конкретною, поінформованою та добровільною (жодних розмитих «ми можемо використати ваші дані для маркетингу… чи ще чогось»), а особи зберігають право відкликати згоду, отримати доступ і виправити дані, а також заперечити проти певних форм профілювання.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ви, напевно, бачили ті спливаючі вікна на сайтах із текстом:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;«Цей сайт використовує cookies для покращення вашого досвіду. Прийняти?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Прийняти все / Прийняти лише необхідні cookies / Дайте мені прочитати 16 сторінок юридичних умов.»&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Це GDPR у дії: запитують вашу згоду (хоча, якщо чесно, сайти люблять робити кнопку &lt;strong&gt;«Прийняти все»&lt;/strong&gt; найбільшою на екрані).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Крім того, важливо, що стаття 22 GDPR встановлює: люди не можуть піддаватися виключно автоматизованому прийняттю рішень, включаючи профілювання, якщо такі рішення мають юридичні чи значні наслідки для них. Коли для рішень використовують автоматизовані системи, особа має право вимагати втручання людини й оскаржити результат.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;З чого складається ваш цифровий слід?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Тепер, коли ми побачили, як вашу цифрову ідентичність можуть використовувати для персоналізації досвіду (або спрямовувати вас у небажаному напрямку), час подивитися, звідки беруться всі ці дані.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Відповідь — у вашому цифровому сліді: сукупності даних, які ви залишаєте щоразу, коли користуєтеся інтернетом.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Цей слід складається з усього, що ви робите онлайн, і має дві основні форми: те, що ви свідомо публікуєте, і те, що збирається тихо у фоновому режимі.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Перша частина — це ваш активний цифровий слід. Це те, що ви свідомо викладаєте: фото в Instagram, посади на LinkedIn, відгуки про товари на Amazon чи підписка на розсилку, яку так і не прочитали. Щоразу, коли ви натискаєте «надіслати», ви додаєте ще одну частинку до пазлу вашого онлайн-образу.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Далі йде ваш пасивний цифровий слід, який трохи хитріший. Це всі дані, які збирають про вас без жодного вашого слова. Сайти фіксують ваші звички перегляду, cookies відстежують, на що ви клікаєте, а телефон може ділитися вашим місцезнаходженням із додатками, про які ви вже й забули. Навіть просте завантаження фото може містити додаткові дані — де й коли воно зроблене, заховані в метаданих файлу.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Чому це важливо: репутація, безпека та контроль&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Цифрові сліди та репутація&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Тепер ми побачили, як формуються, відстежуються й використовуються цифрові ідентичності: іноді для зручності, іноді для комерційної вигоди, а іноді — у значно менш прозорий спосіб. Але поза технічними деталями — суть питання: ваш цифровий слід — це не просто дані. Це репутація, це можливості, це безпека, це особисте.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Кожна дія онлайн залишає слід. З часом ці сліди формують портрет того, ким ви є — принаймні для цифрових систем, компаній і навіть інших людей. Цей портрет може впливати на те, як вас сприймають інші — від потенційних роботодавців до державних службовців.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Багато процесів найму зараз включають тихий онлайн-пошук: перегляд профілів у соцмережах, сканування старих коментарів чи оцінку того, який цифровий образ підтримує людина. За дослідженням 2025 року, 70% роботодавців перевіряють кандидатів онлайн, а 54% зізнаються, що відмовили претендентам через їхні соцмережі.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Неприйнятні пости, образлива мова, непрофесійний контент, навіть постійні орфографічні помилки — усе це може посилати тонкі (або не дуже) сигнали майбутньому роботодавцю. І хоча це може здаватися несправедливим, правда в тому, що люди втрачали пропозиції роботи чи навіть роботу через щось, що колись опублікували онлайн, іноді багато років тому.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ускладнює все те, що значна частина збору даних відбувається у фоновому режимі. Ви цього не бачите, не схвалюєте кожного разу, але воно накопичується, тихо формуючи профіль ваших вподобань, поведінки та зв’язків. Цю інформацію можуть використати для показу персоналізованої реклами, новин, політичного контенту чи спеціальних пропозицій. Але її також можуть продавати, аналізувати чи навіть маніпулювати нею компанії, політичні групи, а в найгірших випадках — кіберзлочинці чи аб’юзери, які використовують цифрові інструменти для стеження, переслідування чи експлуатації інших.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-4.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp;amp; GDPR 4" width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Чому це важливо: безпека та контроль&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;На щастя, в Європейському Союзі GDPR пропонує одну з найсильніших правових основ у світі для захисту персональних даних. Це не просто формальність чи абстрактне право — GDPR є потужним інструментом, який ставить у центр цифрового прийняття рішень саме людину, а не корпорації чи платформи.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Як згадувалося на початку цього модуля, за GDPR ви маєте право знати, які дані про вас збирають, хто і з якою метою. Це називається &lt;em&gt;право на інформування&lt;/em&gt;, і саме тому ви бачите банери cookies, політики конфіденційності та вікна згоди на сайтах. Ви також маєте &lt;em&gt;право на доступ&lt;/em&gt; — тобто можете безкоштовно й без пояснень запитати копію персональних даних, які зберігає про вас будь-яка компанія чи державна установа.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Якщо дані неточні, застарілі чи неповні, ви можете вимагати їх виправлення (&lt;em&gt;право на виправлення&lt;/em&gt;). Якщо вони більше не потрібні або були зібрані без належної правової підстави, ви можете вимагати їх видалення (&lt;em&gt;право на видалення, також відоме як «право бути забутим»&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;У деяких випадках, наприклад, при автоматизованому прийнятті рішень чи поведінковому профілюванні, ви можете заперечити проти використання ваших даних, особливо якщо це впливає на ваші можливості — доступ до послуг, працевлаштування чи житла.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Важливо, що ці права не є лише теоретичними. Кожна організація, що працює в ЄС (або орієнтується на мешканців ЄС), повинна чітко пояснювати, як ви можете їх реалізувати. Наприклад, ви можете написати простий лист із вимогою видалити ваші дані, і компанія зобов’язана відповісти, зазвичай протягом місяця. Цей юридичний обов’язок підкреслюється ініціативою 2025 року Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) від Європейської ради із захисту даних (EDPB), яка перевіряє, як компанії виконують право на видалення за статтею 17 GDPR у всіх 32 органах захисту даних ЄС.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Джерело: CEF 2025: Launch of coordinated enforcement on the right to erasure | European Data Protection Board.

&lt;p&gt;Якщо компанія не виконує або ігнорує ваш запит на видалення, ви маєте право оскаржити це. Ви можете подати скаргу до національного органу захисту даних, який має повноваження розслідувати й накладати санкції за невиконання. У 2025 році органи захисту даних особливо ретельно перевіряють, чи мають компанії чіткі та ефективні процеси видалення всіх даних користувача, включаючи резервні копії, якщо не діють законні винятки (наприклад, обов’язкове зберігання за законом).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Гейміфікаційна активність&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Назва активності: Перетягни та відпусти&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Завдання: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Плитки під зображенням описують тип цифрових даних, які ви залишаєте. Ваше завдання — перетягнути кожен елемент у правильну категорію:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Пасивний цифровий слід&lt;/strong&gt; — інформація, яку збирають про вас без вашої активної участі (наприклад,&lt;br&gt;історія переглядів чи інформація про пристрій)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Активний цифровий слід&lt;/strong&gt; — інформація, яку ви самі публікуєте чи створюєте (наприклад, пости чи повідомлення)&lt;/p&gt;
