This unit introduces the foundational aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the critical role it plays in adult education institutions. Managers will explore what GDPR means in practice, focusing on how institutional roles and responsibilities are defined in terms of accountability. The unit supports the organisation for building a full compliance framework by demystifying the legal definitions and practical obligations that AEIs face when handling learners' and staff members' personal data.

&nbsp;
<h2>The Basics of GDPR in an Educational Context</h2>
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important regulation relating to data privacy and protection in the EU, directly affecting how adult education institutions collect, process, store, and manage personal data. Introduced in 2018, the GDPR enforces strict requirements on organisations that handle data belonging to EU residents, including schools, training centres, and adult education institutions (AEIs).

<strong>GDPR is built on seven principles: lawfulness, fairness and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimisation; accuracy; storage limitation; integrity and confidentiality; and accountability.</strong> AEIs must understand how each principle applies to everyday institutional practices, from enrolment and course participation to digital platform use and data storage.

Under GDPR, <strong>AEIs are considered data controllers or data processors</strong>—sometimes both. A data controller determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, while a data processor handles data on behalf of the controller. Understanding which role your institution plays is critical in defining its obligations.

A core principle of the GDPR is accountability. This means AEIs must not only comply with GDPR but must be able to demonstrate that compliance. This includes maintaining documentation of processing activities, adopting data protection policies, conducting risk assessments, and ensuring staff training. Institutions are expected to integrate data protection by design and by default, meaning that data safety measures must be built into every system and process from the start.

Non-compliance with GDPR can result in significant fines and reputational damage. However, more importantly, it can compromise the trust of learners and staff. Institutional accountability is not simply a legal obligation—it's a foundation for ethical practice and inclusive, secure digital education.

&nbsp;
<h2>Roles and Responsibilities of Data Controllers and Data Processors</h2>
In the context of GDPR, understanding whether your institution is a data controller, data processor, or both is fundamental. A data controller determines the purpose and means of processing personal data, while a processor acts on behalf of the controller and processes data according to their instructions.

<strong>For example</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>When an AEI collects data for course registration and uses its own internal system, it acts as a data controller and a data processor.</li>
 	<li>When the institution uses a third-party Learning Management System (LMS), that service provider is the data processor, and the AEI remains the data controller.</li>
</ul>
Managers must ensure that all data processors are GDPR-compliant. This involves reviewing and signing Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) that outline how data is handled, secured, and erased. The AEI remains liable for breaches by data processors unless due diligence was performed.

Importantly, accountability goes beyond technical security. It includes transparent data policies, clear documentation, and regular staff training. Managers must ensure that:
<ul>
 	<li>Data processing activities are mapped and justified.</li>
 	<li>Legal bases for data processing are clearly defined (e.g. consent, contract, legal obligation).</li>
 	<li>Risks are assessed and mitigated proactively.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h2>The Principle of Accountability in Action</h2>
Accountability is not only one of the seven GDPR principles—it is a foundational expectation. Institutions must prove that they are complying with the GDPR. This means keeping evidence of decision-making, training, policies, and procedures.

Key tools to support accountability include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Records of Processing Activities (ROPA):</strong> A detailed register of what data is collected, why, for how long, and who has access.</li>
 	<li><strong>Privacy Policies:</strong> Publicly available statements that explain how personal data is used.</li>
 	<li><strong>Data Protection Officers (DPOs):</strong> In some cases, mandatory staff responsible for overseeing GDPR implementation.</li>
</ul>
The GDPR does not require institutions to simply react to data breaches—it mandates that they work to prevent them. Regular internal audits, updates to privacy policies, and transparent communication with data subjects (i.e. learners and staff) are part of this proactive approach.

By embedding data protection into the organisational culture, managers demonstrate leadership and create a safer environment for all stakeholders.
