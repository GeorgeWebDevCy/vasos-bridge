<p>Digital technologies are deeply embedded in our daily lives, shaping how we work, learn, and connect.&nbsp;While they bring many opportunities, they also have significant environmental, social, and ethical&nbsp;implications. This unit introduces the concept of digital sustainability, explaining why it is a critical issue&nbsp;for individuals, organisations, and society as a whole. Learners will explore the scope and principles of&nbsp;digital sustainability, assess the environmental footprint of digitalisation, and reflect on its social and&nbsp;ethical dimensions. The unit provides the foundation for understanding how digital practices can align&nbsp;with long-term sustainable development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1.1 Defining Digital Sustainability</h3>
<p><strong>What does Sustainability mean?</strong></p>
<p>Sustainability is not just a concept - it is a guiding vision for how we live, innovate, and build the future. At its heart lies the often-quoted definition from the UN World Commission on Environment and Development: &ldquo;sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UCLA Sustainability Committee expands this perspective, describing it as &ldquo;the integration of environmental health, social equity and economic vitality in order to create thriving, healthy, diverse and resilient communities for this generation and generations to come. The practice of sustainability recognizes how these issues are interconnected and requires a systems approach and an acknowledgement of complexity.&rdquo; Put simply, sustainability is about making choices today that protect the ecological, social, and economic health of tomorrow. It reminds us that resources are finite and must be used wisely&mdash;and ultimately, it is about the legacy we leave for our children and grandchildren.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://sustain.ucla.edu/what-is-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is DIGITAL Sustainability?</h2>
<p>The concept of digital sustainability builds on the broader idea of sustainability, which gained global attention during the Rio process through collaboration between social movements, academia, politics, and business. It reflects the same core values as sustainability: <strong><a href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/id/30da7882-a73e-4495-904d-53c60843c87f/978-3-031-61749-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Equality: equal rights and opportunities for present and future generations.<br><br></li>
<li>Harmony: collaboration and shared responsibility to improve quality of life.<br><br></li>
<li>Self-determination: empowerment of individuals, communities, and nations to protect their environment and independence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applied to the digital sphere, these values suggest that digital technologies should contribute to a sustainable future. Yet, definitions differ in how they integrate the three pillars of sustainability:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1.1 Defining Digital Sustainability</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environmental:</strong> reducing resource use, emissions, and supporting renewable energy.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Economic:</strong> ensuring prosperity without exhausting natural or social resources.<br><br></li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> fostering strong, inclusive communities while safeguarding future generations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some scholars emphasise sustainability by digital - using technology to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - while others highlight sustainability of digital technologies themselves. A more comprehensive definition combines these perspectives:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Digital sustainability refers to the design, development, deployment, and decommissioning of digital resources and artefacts with the goal of improving environmental, social, and economic welfare.&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; P. ROSATI ET AL<br><br></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1.2 The Three Pillars of Sustainability</h3>
<p>To better understand how these dimensions shape digital sustainability, it is useful to take a closer look&nbsp;at the three pillars of sustainability. Each pillar brings its own focus&mdash;environmental, economic, and&nbsp;social&mdash;but none of them can stand alone. Their strength lies not only in their individual contributions&nbsp;but also in the intersections where they overlap. The following sections unpack each pillar in more&nbsp;detail, showing both its core meaning and how it connects to the others. <strong><a href="https://agnext.colostate.edu/2023/01/10/what-is-sustainability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.1 Unit 1 - The Three Pillars of Sustainability" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.1-Unit-1-The-Three-Pillars-of-Sustainability-0.webp" alt="5.1 Unit 1 - The Three Pillars of Sustainability" width="auto" height="auto"></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1.3 Social and Ethical Dimensions</h3>
<p><strong>How can digital solutions support equality, inclusion, and well-being&nbsp;for all?</strong></p>
<p>In Topic 1.2, we introduced the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic, and social. While the environmental and economic dimensions often dominate debates around digitalisation, the social pillar is just as critical. It asks: How do digital technologies shape our communities, protect human dignity, and promote fairness? Ensuring the social sustainability of digitalisation means designing systems that serve all members of society &mdash; not only the digitally skilled, but also those at the margins. In the long run, inclusion strengthens trust, encourages adoption, and creates real social and economic value.</p>
<p>One of the most tangible ways to promote social sustainability is through usability. When digital platforms are simple and intuitive, they empower people across different levels of digital literacy. For older adults or those with limited education, user-friendly interfaces reduce stress and confusion while protecting health and well-being. In other words, design that is human-friendly is also socially sustainable.</p>
<p>Closely related is accessibility, which ensures that people with disabilities can fully participate. This requires compatibility with assistive technologies, such as screen readers or captions, and adherence to legal frameworks. At the European level, the <strong><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32021D1339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Accessibility Directive</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Accessibility Act</a></strong> (entering into force in 2025) ensure that products and services are accessible to everyone, regardless of ability.</p>
<p>Social sustainability also means recognising cultural and linguistic diversity. Localising digital services &mdash; by offering multiple languages and adjusting for local contexts &mdash; prevents exclusion of minority communities while preserving diversity. This expands participation and broadens the user base. But digitalisation also carries risks to well-being. The spread of misinformation can divide societies and harm vulnerable groups, while addictive features in apps or games can negatively impact mental health, particularly among youth. Tackling these issues requires ethical design, responsible regulation, and digital literacy that fosters critical thinking. <strong><a href="https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/latest/briefs/beyond-green-ict-building-truly-sustainable-digital-future-deep-dive#:~:text=Initiatives%20focused%20on%20digital%20inclusion,Rights%20Action%20Plan%2C%20etc)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong></p>
<p>At a systemic level, ethics in governance is vital. Artificial intelligence and data-driven systems must be transparent, fair, and accountable to prevent bias or discrimination. European legislation such as&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the AI Act</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Services Act</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Markets Act</a></strong> embed these principles directly into regulation. Finally, social sustainability extends across the digital divide and supply chains. Unequal access to skills and technology remains a barrier, as highlighted in the <strong><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/state-digital-decade-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Digital Decade 2025</a></strong>. Closing this gap requires investment in digital literacy and inclusion. At the same time, the global production of devices often relies on unfair labour practices. Promoting fair wages, safety, and dignity for all workers &mdash; from miners to platform workers &mdash; ensures that digitalisation benefits society at every stage <strong><a href="https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en/latest/briefs/beyond-green-ict-building-truly-sustainable-digital-future-deep-dive#:~:text=Initiatives%20focused%20on%20digital%20inclusion,Rights%20Action%20Plan%2C%20etc)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></strong>.</p>

<h3><br>1.4 Environmental Footprint of Digitalisation</h3>
<p>Digital technologies provide immense benefits to society, but they also come with significant environmental costs. In Europe, the environmental footprint of digitalisation can be understood in four key areas: energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, and electronic waste (e-waste).</p>
