<p>Now that you've taken your first steps on the road to digital safety, it&rsquo;s time to get to know someone you might not have officially met yet - your digital self.</p>
<p>Every time you sign up for an account, post a photo, click on an ad, or even just browse for dinner recipes at midnight (no judgment), you leave behind small pieces of information. Over time, these pieces form your digital identity, a kind of online version of you, built from data.</p>
<p>In this module, we&rsquo;ll explore what that identity is made of, how it&rsquo;s used (and sometimes misused), and why it matters more than you might think. We&rsquo;ll also look at how your digital footprint, everything you leave behind online, can shape your opportunities, your privacy, and even your reputation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is Digital Identity?</h2>
<p>This part of the Unit 2 introduces the concept of digital identity - the unique collection of data points that represent a person in the online world. Think of it as your virtual fingerprint, made up of everything from your name and birthdate to your favourite online shop, the way you scroll through news articles, and even when you tend to check your phone.</p>
<p>These data points include obvious items like your email address, phone number, and profile photo, but also less visible details: your browser search history (once considered anonymous), device information, location data, and behavioural patterns, such as when you like to shop online, which types of ads you click, or whether you're a night owl or an early bird based on your app activity.</p>
<p>Unlike a passport, your digital identity isn&rsquo;t issued to you in one neat package. Instead, it&rsquo;s built over time, piece by piece, as you move through your day.</p>
<p>Consider common activities: signing up for Netflix, participating in online learning, or using Google Maps. When registering for Netflix, users share their name, email, payment details, and often, viewing habits. Each small action adds another brushstroke to the digital portrait of <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>In a way, your digital identity is like a shadow version of yourself that follows you from platform to platform, collecting bits of information along the way. And depending on how it&rsquo;s managed, it can either open doors or cause unintended trouble.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, the General Data Protection Regulation says that most of the information forming your digital identity is considered personal data. In simple terms, this means that if a piece of information can be used to identify you, it falls under GDPR protection.</p>
<p>This includes obvious things like your name or ID number, but also less obvious details such as your IP address, location data, or even your preferences based on how you use certain websites or apps. Even if one data point alone doesn&rsquo;t reveal your full identity, it might when combined with others, and that&rsquo;s enough for the GDPR to apply.</p>
<p>The regulation has prompted organizations to develop more robust digital identity management systems and offer users rights such as access, rectification, and erasure. This is reflected in GDPR enforcement cases: in 2023, Meta (Facebook) was fined &euro;1.2 billion for transferring EU users&rsquo; personal data to the US in violation of GDPR rules, highlighting the real-world implications of managing digital identities.</p>
<p><strong>👉 <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source: 1.2 billion euro fine for Facebook as a result of EDPB binding decision | European Data Protection Board. (n.d.)</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>So, if the data can be linked back to you, then it&rsquo;s protected, and you have rights over how it&rsquo;s collected, stored, and used.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>How Digital Identity Is Used (and Misused)</h2>
<p>Digital identity, built through social media accounts, online banking profiles, and government-issued IDs, acts as a central credential that unlocks access to platforms, services, and civic participation. In 2025, Juniper Research projected that digital identity verification checks would reach 86 billion, underscoring its ubiquity in situations like logging into apps and bank accounts to accessing healthcare and public services. (Source: The power and promise of digital identity. (n.d.). DXC Technology. <a href="https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://dxc.com/us/en/insights/growth-drivers/the-power-and-promise-of-digital-identity</a>)</p>
<p>Beyond simply logging you in, your digital identity also fuels personalised experiences, like when Spotify magically knows you need a 80s throwback playlist on a Monday morning, or when an online shop seems to read your mind and suggests exactly what you didn&rsquo;t know you needed. These tailored touches are convenient, but they rely on collecting and analysing a lot of your data.</p>
<p>Surveys show that while most people (around 63%) enjoy getting personalised content, more than half also expect something in return, like stronger privacy and security. Fair enough, right? But behind the scenes, this data is often used to power advertising systems that are far more interested in selling than serenading you.</p>
<p>(Source: Wendel, S. (2024, July 2). Digital Identity: Finding the balance between personalization and security. Experian Insights. <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/digital-identity-finding-the-balance-between-personalization-and-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.experian.com/blogs/insights/digital-identity-finding-the-balance-between-personalization-and-security</a>)</p>
<p>But relying so heavily on personal profiles comes with risks. For starters, there&rsquo;s the obvious, like someone pretending to be you online, stealing your identity, or your data being leaked in a breach.</p>
<p>When we say that your data could be &ldquo;leaked in a breach,&rdquo; we mean that information about you, like your name, email, password, or even bank details might end up in the wrong hands because a company or platform didn&rsquo;t protect it properly.</p>
<p>Imagine a website you&rsquo;ve used gets hacked. The attackers break into its systems and steal user data stored there. If you had an account on that site, your information might be part of what&rsquo;s stolen - this is what we call a data breach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why tools like multi-factor authentication (yes, those annoying codes sent to your phone) and biometric logins (like fingerprints or face recognition) are more important than ever. They may seem like small steps, but they&rsquo;re big shields.</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp; GDPR 2" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-2.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp; GDPR 2" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also risks that are harder to see. Many websites and apps use algorithms, basically sets of rules written by programmers, to make decisions about people automatically. These systems look at your data and try to predict things about you: how reliable you are, what you might buy, or even what kind of job or loan you &ldquo;should&rdquo; get.</p>
<p>For example, if an algorithm decides you&rsquo;re not a good match for a job based on your online activity or profile, you might never even know you were screened out. The same can happen with loans, insurance prices, or which political messages you see online.</p>
<p>GDPR establishes a critical legal framework to protect users in the European Union. Under GDPR, personal data use must be lawful, transparent, and purpose-limited. Consent must be specific, informed, and freely given, (No vague &ldquo;we might use your data for marketing&hellip; or something.&rdquo;) with individuals retaining the rights to withdraw consent, access and correct data, and to object to certain forms of profiling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen those pop-ups on websites that say things like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This website uses cookies to enhance your experience. Accept?<br><strong>Accept All / Accept only necessary cookies/ Let me read 16 pages of legal terms.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s GDPR in action: asking for your permission (though, let&rsquo;s be honest, websites do love making the &ldquo;<strong>Accept All</strong>&rdquo; button the biggest one on the screen).</p>
<p>On top of that, importantly, GDPR&rsquo;s Article 22 states that people cannot be subject solely to automated decision-making, including profiling, when such decisions have legal or significant effects on them. Whenever automated systems are used for decisions, individuals must be able to request human intervention and challenge the outcome.</p>
<p><em>(Source: ICO. (n.d.). Rights related to automated decision making including profiling. <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/individual-rights/individual-rights/rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling</a>)</em></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>What is your Digital Footprint Made Of?</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how your digital identity can be used to personalise your experience (or steer you in ways you didn&rsquo;t ask for) it&rsquo;s time to look at where all that data comes from in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer lies in your Digital footprint: the collection of data you leave behind every time you use the internet.</p>
<p>This footprint is made up of everything you do online, and it comes in two main flavours: what you share on purpose, and what gets collected quietly in the background.</p>
<p>The first part is called your active digital footprint. Those are the things you choose to put out there: the Instagram photos you post, the job titles you list on LinkedIn, the product reviews you leave on Amazon, or the time you signed up for that newsletter you never quite got around to reading. Every time you click &ldquo;submit,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re adding another piece to the puzzle of your online self.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s your passive digital footprint, which is a bit sneakier. This includes all the data that&rsquo;s gathered about you without you typing a single word. Websites log your browsing habits, cookies track what you click, and your phone might be sharing your location with apps you forgot you even downloaded. Even something as simple as uploading a photo can carry extra data, like where and when it was taken, tucked away in the file&rsquo;s metadata.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters: Reputation, Safety, and Control</h2>
<h3>Digital Footprints and Reputation</h3>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;ve seen how digital identities are shaped, tracked, and used: sometimes for convenience, sometimes for commercial gain, and sometimes in ways that are far less transparent. But beyond the technical mechanics lies the heart of the issue: your digital footprint is not just data. It&rsquo;s reputation, it&rsquo;s opportunity, it&rsquo;s safety, and it&rsquo;s personal.</p>
<p>Every action online leaves a trace. Over time, these traces form a portrait of who you are, at least as far as digital systems, companies, and even other people are concerned. That portrait can influence how others view you, from potential employers to public officials.</p>
<p>Many hiring processes now involve quiet online searches: reviewing social media profiles, scanning old comments, or evaluating what kind of digital presence a person maintains. According to 2025 research, 70% of employers screen candidates online, with 54% admitting they have eliminated prospects based on social media feeds.</p>
<p><em>(Source: Javed, A. (2025, June 5). 15+ social media recruitment Statistics You have to know. Qureos Hiring Guide. <a href="https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics</a>)</em></p>
<p>Inappropriate posts, inflammatory language, unprofessional content, even consistent spelling mistakes: these things can send subtle (or not so subtle) signals to a future employer. And while it may feel unfair, the truth is that people have lost job offers, or even employment, because of something they once posted online, sometimes years earlier.</p>
<p>What makes all of this even more complex is that much of the data collection happens in the background. You don&rsquo;t see it, you don&rsquo;t approve it actively each time, and yet it accumulates, quietly building a profile of your preferences, behaviours, and relationships. This information can be used to show you personalised ads, news stories, political content, or special offers. But it can also be sold, analysed, or even manipulated by companies, political groups, and in the worst cases, cybercriminals or abusive individuals using digital tools to track, harass, or exploit others.</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp; GDPR 4" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/MODULE-1-Unit-2-INTRODUCTION-TO-DIGITAL-SAFETY-GDPR-4.webp" alt="MODULE 1 Unit 2 INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL SAFETY &amp; GDPR 4" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Why It Matters: Safety and Control</h2>
<p>Fortunately, in the European Union, the GDPR offers one of the strongest legal frameworks in the world to protect individuals&rsquo; personal data. Far more than a formality or an abstract right, the GDPR is a powerful tool that places individuals, not corporations or platforms, at the centre of digital decision-making.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the beginning of this Module, under GDPR, you are entitled to know what data is being collected about you, by whom, and for what reason. This is known as the <em>right to be informed</em>, and it is the reason you see cookie banners, privacy policies, and consent boxes when visiting websites. You also have the <em>right of access</em>, meaning you can request a copy of the personal data any company or public institution holds about you, free of charge and without needing to justify the request.</p>
<p>If the data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, you may request a correction (<em>right to rectification</em>). If it is no longer necessary, or was collected without proper legal basis, you can ask for it to be deleted (<em>right to erasure, also known as the &ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>In some cases, such as automated decision-making or behavioural profiling, you can object to how your data is being used, especially when it impacts your opportunities, such as access to services, employment, or housing.</p>
<p>Importantly, these rights are not merely theoretical. Every organisation operating in the EU (or targeting EU residents) must provide clear instructions for how you can exercise them. For example, you can write a simple email requesting deletion of your data, and the company is legally required to respond, often within one month. This legal obligation is emphasized in the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) initiative by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which audits how companies comply with the right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR across all 32 EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs).</p>
<p><em>(Source: CEF 2025: Launch of coordinated enforcement on the right to erasure | European Data Protection Board. (n.d.). <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en</a>)</em></p>
<p>If a company fails to comply or ignores your deletion request, you have the right to escalate the matter. You can file a complaint with your national Data Protection Authority, which has the power to investigate and impose penalties for non-compliance. The 2025 enforcement focus by DPAs is particularly rigorous, requiring companies to demonstrate they have clear and efficient processes to remove all user data, including backups, unless lawful exceptions apply (such as legal retention obligations).</p>

<p>When we say that your data could be &ldquo;leaked in a breach,&rdquo; we mean that information about you, like your name, email, password, or even bank details might end up in the wrong hands because a company or platform didn&rsquo;t protect it properly.</p>
<p>Imagine a website you&rsquo;ve used gets hacked. The attackers break into its systems and steal user data stored there. If you had an account on that site, your information might be part of what&rsquo;s stolen - this is what we call a data breach.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why tools like multi-factor authentication (yes, those annoying codes sent to your phone) and biometric logins (like fingerprints or face recognition) are more important than ever. They may seem like small steps, but they&rsquo;re big shields.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also risks that are harder to see. Many websites and apps use algorithms, basically sets of rules written by programmers, to make decisions about people automatically. These systems look at your data and try to predict things about you: how reliable you are, what you might buy, or even what kind of job or loan you &ldquo;should&rdquo; get.</p>
<p>For example, if an algorithm decides you&rsquo;re not a good match for a job based on your online activity or profile, you might never even know you were screened out. The same can happen with loans, insurance prices, or which political messages you see online.</p>
<p>GDPR establishes a critical legal framework to protect users in the European Union. Under GDPR, personal data use must be lawful, transparent, and purpose-limited. Consent must be specific, informed, and freely given, (No vague &ldquo;we might use your data for marketing&hellip; or something.&rdquo;) with individuals retaining the rights to withdraw consent, access and correct data, and to object to certain forms of profiling.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen those pop-ups on websites that say things like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This website uses cookies to enhance your experience. Accept?<br><strong>Accept All / Accept only necessary cookies/ Let me read 16 pages of legal terms.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s GDPR in action: asking for your permission (though, let&rsquo;s be honest, websites do love making the &ldquo;<strong>Accept All</strong>&rdquo; button the biggest one on the screen).</p>
<p>On top of that, importantly, GDPR&rsquo;s Article 22 states that people cannot be subject solely to automated decision-making, including profiling, when such decisions have legal or significant effects on them. Whenever automated systems are used for decisions, individuals must be able to request human intervention and challenge the outcome.</p>

<h2>What is your Digital Footprint Made Of?</h2>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve seen how your digital identity can be used to personalise your experience (or steer you in ways you didn&rsquo;t ask for) it&rsquo;s time to look at where all that data comes from in the first place.</p>
<p>The answer lies in your Digital footprint: the collection of data you leave behind every time you use the internet.</p>
<p>This footprint is made up of everything you do online, and it comes in two main flavours: what you share on purpose, and what gets collected quietly in the background.</p>
<p>The first part is called your active digital footprint. Those are the things you choose to put out there: the Instagram photos you post, the job titles you list on LinkedIn, the product reviews you leave on Amazon, or the time you signed up for that newsletter you never quite got around to reading. Every time you click &ldquo;submit,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re adding another piece to the puzzle of your online self.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s your passive digital footprint, which is a bit sneakier. This includes all the data that&rsquo;s gathered about you without you typing a single word. Websites log your browsing habits, cookies track what you click, and your phone might be sharing your location with apps you forgot you even downloaded. Even something as simple as uploading a photo can carry extra data, like where and when it was taken, tucked away in the file&rsquo;s metadata.</p>

<h2>Why It Matters: Reputation, Safety, and Control</h2>
<h3>Digital Footprints and Reputation</h3>
<p>By now, we&rsquo;ve seen how digital identities are shaped, tracked, and used: sometimes for convenience, sometimes for commercial gain, and sometimes in ways that are far less transparent. But beyond the technical mechanics lies the heart of the issue: your digital footprint is not just data. It&rsquo;s reputation, it&rsquo;s opportunity, it&rsquo;s safety, and it&rsquo;s personal.</p>
<p>Every action online leaves a trace. Over time, these traces form a portrait of who you are, at least as far as digital systems, companies, and even other people are concerned. That portrait can influence how others view you, from potential employers to public officials.</p>
<p>Many hiring processes now involve quiet online searches: reviewing social media profiles, scanning old comments, or evaluating what kind of digital presence a person maintains. According to 2025 research, 70% of employers screen candidates online, with 54% admitting they have eliminated prospects based on social media feeds.</p>

Qureos Hiring Guide. <a href="https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.qureos.com/hiring-guide/social-media-recruitment-statistics</a>)</em></p>
<p>Inappropriate posts, inflammatory language, unprofessional content, even consistent spelling mistakes: these things can send subtle (or not so subtle) signals to a future employer. And while it may feel unfair, the truth is that people have lost job offers, or even employment, because of something they once posted online, sometimes years earlier.</p>
<p>What makes all of this even more complex is that much of the data collection happens in the background. You don&rsquo;t see it, you don&rsquo;t approve it actively each time, and yet it accumulates, quietly building a profile of your preferences, behaviours, and relationships. This information can be used to show you personalised ads, news stories, political content, or special offers. But it can also be sold, analysed, or even manipulated by companies, political groups, and in the worst cases, cybercriminals or abusive individuals using digital tools to track, harass, or exploit others.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Why It Matters: Safety and Control</h2>
<p>Fortunately, in the European Union, the GDPR offers one of the strongest legal frameworks in the world to protect individuals&rsquo; personal data. Far more than a formality or an abstract right, the GDPR is a powerful tool that places individuals, not corporations or platforms, at the centre of digital decision-making.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the beginning of this Module, under GDPR, you are entitled to know what data is being collected about you, by whom, and for what reason. This is known as the <em>right to be informed</em>, and it is the reason you see cookie banners, privacy policies, and consent boxes when visiting websites. You also have the <em>right of access</em>, meaning you can request a copy of the personal data any company or public institution holds about you, free of charge and without needing to justify the request.</p>
<p>If the data is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete, you may request a correction (<em>right to rectification</em>). If it is no longer necessary, or was collected without proper legal basis, you can ask for it to be deleted (<em>right to erasure, also known as the &ldquo;right to be forgotten&rdquo;</em>).</p>
<p>In some cases, such as automated decision-making or behavioural profiling, you can object to how your data is being used, especially when it impacts your opportunities, such as access to services, employment, or housing.</p>
<p>Importantly, these rights are not merely theoretical. Every organisation operating in the EU (or targeting EU residents) must provide clear instructions for how you can exercise them. For example, you can write a simple email requesting deletion of your data, and the company is legally required to respond, often within one month. This legal obligation is emphasized in the 2025 Coordinated Enforcement Framework (CEF) initiative by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which audits how companies comply with the right to erasure under Article 17 of the GDPR across all 32 EU Data Protection Authorities (DPAs).</p>
<p><em>(Source: CEF 2025: Launch of coordinated enforcement on the right to erasure | European Data Protection Board. (n.d.). <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2025/cef-2025-launch-coordinated-enforcement-right-erasure_en</a>)</em></p>
<p>If a company fails to comply or ignores your deletion request, you have the right to escalate the matter. You can file a complaint with your national Data Protection Authority, which has the power to investigate and impose penalties for non-compliance. The 2025 enforcement focus by DPAs is particularly rigorous, requiring companies to demonstrate they have clear and efficient processes to remove all user data, including backups, unless lawful exceptions apply (such as legal retention obligations).</p>
