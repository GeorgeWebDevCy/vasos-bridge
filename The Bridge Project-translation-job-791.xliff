It can happen when we talk to someone, fill out a form, or use a mobile phone. But not all information is the same. Some of it is personal and needs to be protected. In this unit you will learn what personal data is, how to tell it apart from general information, and why protecting it matters. You will also see why this topic is especially important for migrant women. The goal is to help you feel more confident and better prepared to understand what happens to your data in everyday life.
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 1 - Definition of Personal Data&lt;/h2&gt;
Personal data is any information that relates to a person who can be identified, either directly or indirectly. This includes obvious things like your name, photo, or phone number. But it can also be less obvious, like your location, voice or even how many children you have. If someone can tell who you are based on the information, it counts as personal data.

There are &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;different types of personal data&lt;/span&gt;, like basic personal data, sensitive personal data, financial data, online identifiers &amp;amp; behavioural data, children’s data or employment data. Let’s look at sensitive &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;personal data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as an example, they are called sensitive because they say something very private about you. This includes things like your religion, health condition, or immigration status. These need stronger protection, because they could be used in ways that are unfair or even dangerous. Even simple things, like your birthday or home address, can be personal and should be shared only when really necessary. For example, giving your address to a trusted doctor is fine, but writing it in a public online form could put your safety at risk.

For migrant women, it’s important to know that you have &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;the right to keep your information private&lt;/span&gt;. Sometimes people feel like they have to give out their data to get access to services or help. That’s why it’s good to understand what kind of information is being collected, who is asking for it, and whether you really need to give it. When you feel informed and confident, you can make better choices and protect your privacy more effectively.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 2 - The Difference Between Personal and Nonpersonal Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal vs Non-Personal Data&lt;/h2&gt;
Not all information is personal. Some types of data describe general things and cannot tell us who a specific person is. Understanding this difference helps you know what information needs to be protected and what is not risky to share.

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Personal data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is any information that relates to a person who can be identified. This includes your name and surname, home address, an email address such as &lt;em&gt;name.surname@company.com&lt;/em&gt;, phone number or a photo of your face. It also includes technical things like your IP address, cookie ID, phone advertising ID or a patient number in a hospital system that refers to you. Even if your name is not written, the data can still be personal if someone can figure out who it belongs to.

&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-personal data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is information that cannot be linked to a specific person. For example, a company registration number, the email address &lt;em&gt;info@company.com&lt;/em&gt;, or the number of visitors to a website. Also, data that has been made anonymous in a way that nobody can ever identify the person is no longer considered personal. But this works only if the anonymisation is truly permanent.

Sometimes the difference between personal and non-personal data is not so clear. For example, a child’s drawing might look like just a simple picture. But if it was made during a therapy session or tells something about the child’s home situation or emotions, it could say a lot about a specific person. In that case, the drawing may also be considered personal data. That is why it is good to be careful and ask questions when sharing any information.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 3 - Why Protecting Personal Data is Important – Especially for Migrant Women&lt;/h2&gt;
Protecting personal data is not just a legal topic. It is about &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;safety&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;dignity&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;control over your own life&lt;/span&gt;. When your personal information is in the wrong hands, it can be used in ways that harm you. That is why it is important to understand what happens to your data and how to keep it safe.

For example, if someone shares your address or phone number without your permission, it could lead to unwanted contact or even danger. If a photo of you is published online without your knowledge, you might feel exposed or uncomfortable. And if someone knows private information about your family, health, or immigration status, they might use it to pressure or manipulate you.

This risk is even higher for women who are migrants or refugees. You might be new in a country, not speak the language well, or not know your rights. You might depend on different institutions, services, or people for help. That makes it easier for others to ask for your personal data without explaining why, or to misuse it without you noticing.

When you learn to recognise what personal data is and how it can be protected, you are taking a step toward being more independent. You can start asking questions, saying no when something feels wrong, and making sure your information is shared only when truly necessary.
