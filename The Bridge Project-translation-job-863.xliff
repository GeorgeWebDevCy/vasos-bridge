<p>This unit sets the stage for exploring what digital wellbeing really means and why it matters in our everyday lives. You&rsquo;ll reflect on how technology shapes your routines, attention, and mental health&mdash; often in ways that go unnoticed. We&rsquo;ll define key dimensions of digital wellbeing and challenge common misconceptions. The goal is not to reject technology, but to use it more consciously and with greater balance. By the end of this unit, you&rsquo;ll gain a clearer sense of your digital habits and begin building awareness&mdash;the first step toward healthier and more intentional tech use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.1 The Meaning and Framework of Digital Wellbeing</h2>
<h3>What is Digital Wellbeing?</h3>
<p>Digital wellbeing, also known as digital wellness or digital health, refers to the positive and intentional relationship individuals have with technology. It encompasses both the benefits and the potential negative impacts of digital devices and online activities on our mental, physical, social, and emotional health. Rather than letting technology control us, digital wellbeing is about understanding how it affects us and making conscious choices to find balance in our digital lives. It is a multifaceted concept that can be approached from different perspectives and across various contexts: <a href="https://digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk/what-is-digital-capability/digital-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<p>From an individual perspective, digital wellbeing relates to our personal, learning, and work lives. It involves recognising both the positive contributions and the risks of digital engagement, and learning how to manage our behaviours, habits, and boundaries to support our wellbeing.</p>
<p>From a societal or organisational perspective, the responsibility extends to those who design, provide, and manage digital systems, platforms, and services. These stakeholders must ensure that their tools are accessible, inclusive, and supportive, and that they help empower users to engage in ways that protect and improve wellbeing. <a href="https://digitalcapability.jisc.ac.uk/what-is-digital-capability/digital-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<p>To help individuals apply these ideas in everyday life, the Digital Wellbeing Framework outlines five key areas where technology and wellbeing intersect:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Digital Wellbeing Framework &ndash; Key Dimensions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Digital Consumption:</strong> Making informed and intentional decisions when engaging with digital products and services; reading and writing reviews to support smarter use.<br><br><strong>Digital Social Relations:</strong> Building and maintaining meaningful relationships online by participating in respectful, positive digital communities.<br><br><strong>Digital Health:</strong> Using technology to improve mental and physical health, such as through fitness trackers, mindfulness apps, or sleep-monitoring tools.<br><br><strong>Digital Employment: </strong>Upskilling through online education and using digital tools for more efficient, flexible, and balanced working conditions.<br><br><strong>Digital Civic Participation:</strong> Taking part in civic and social life by raising awareness for causes, collaborating on digital platforms, and contributing to social change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.2 How Technology Impacts Mental and Physical Health</h2>
<p>Technology is everywhere - on our desks, in our pockets, even on our wrists. It helps us work, learn, connect, and stay entertained. But just like too much sugar, too much screen time can become unhealthy. The impact of digital technology on mental and physical health is what experts call a &ldquo;double-edged sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across Europe, internet use has become nearly universal. In 2024, 97% of people aged 16&ndash;29 and 88% of the total population in the EU reported using the internet every day. In comparison, just 65% of the overall population and 89% of young people used the internet daily in 2015 (Eurostat, 2024). This rapid and consistent increase highlights the growing integration of digital tools into all areas of life&mdash;and underscores the importance of reflecting on their health implications. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Young_people_-_digital_world&amp;%3A~%3Atext=97%2CEU%20use%20the%20internet%20daily" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<h3><strong><br></strong><img class="img-float-right" style="font-size: medium;font-weight: 400;float: right" title="4.2 tech neck" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/4.2-tech-neck.webp?t=1757970745" alt="woman suffering from neck pain" width="auto" height="auto">The Physical Toll of Tech<strong><br></strong></h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the physical side.<br>On the physical side, hours spent in front of screens, without breaks, can lead to stiff necks, aching backs, and tired eyes. Have you ever rubbed your eyes after scrolling too long or felt sore after a day of working from the couch? That&rsquo;s not just you. In Europe, adults spend on average 4.7 to 6.5 hours sitting each day, often with poor posture. Over time, this increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Many workers also report neck and shoulder pain from long hours at digital devices, a condition now widely called &ldquo;tech neck.&rdquo; <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Young_people_-_digital_world&amp;%3A~%3Atext=97%2CEU%20use%20the%20internet%20daily" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Hidden Impact on Mental Wellbeing</h3>
<p>And what about our mind?<br><br>The mental effects of technology are increasingly recognised as complex and multifaceted. On the one hand, digital platforms support connection, learning, and expression&mdash;especially among young people. On the other hand, excessive or unregulated use may disrupt emotional balance, social relationships, and sleep.<br><br>A recent report by the WHO Regional Office for Europe (2024) found that 11 % of European adolescents now show signs of problematic social media use, up from 7 % in 2018. This increase is linked to higher rates of anxiety, low mood, and sleep disruption. One of the most commonly cited psychological mechanisms behind this is FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)&mdash;a social and emotional pressure amplified by constant comparison online. When others&rsquo; lives appear more exciting, successful or connected, self- doubt and compulsive checking behaviours can easily follow. <a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/25-09-2024-teens--screens-and-mental-health#%3A~%3Atext%3Duse%20compared%20to%20non%2Coverall%20health%20and%20academic%20performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a><br><br><strong><br>A brief pause for self-reflection:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How many hours a day do you spend on screens outside of work or study?</li>
<li>Have you ever felt emotionally drained after just &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; checking your phone?</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="img-float-left" style="float: left" title="4.2 woman relaxing" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/4.2-woman-relaxing.webp?t=1757970882" alt="woman-relaxing" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>Sleep is another piece of the puzzle. Screen light, especially at night, confuses our brains and delays the release of melatonin, the hormone that helps us sleep. This is why using your phone before bed can make it harder to fall asleep or leave you feeling groggy the next morning.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not all bad. In fact, moderate and mindful use of digital tools can actually support our wellbeing. For example, using fitness trackers, mindfulness apps, or connecting with friends during difficult times can help us feel supported and stay healthy.</p>
<p>So the key isn&rsquo;t to stop using technology&mdash;it&rsquo;s to understand how it affects us and find a healthy balance. Being aware of the signs of digital overload is the first step toward better digital wellbeing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1.3 The Role of Awareness in Achieving Digital Balance</h2>
<p>Achieving digital balance is not merely about restricting device use or disconnecting from technology, but rather about cultivating awareness&mdash;a conscious understanding and monitoring of one&rsquo;s digital habits. Awareness empowers individuals to make intentional choices, fostering healthier relationships with technology.</p>
<p>In a world filled with constant notifications, infinite scrolling, and blurred boundaries between work and rest, many of us move through our digital lives on autopilot. Becoming aware of how, when, and why we use digital tools is the first step toward shaping a more balanced digital lifestyle.</p>
<h3><br>Why Awareness Matters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Foundation for Change: Awareness helps identify patterns, triggers, and emotions tied to digital behaviour, enabling individuals to make informed adjustments.</li>
<li>Combats Automatic Use: Many people engage with devices out of habit or impulse. Mindful recognition of this tendency helps disrupt automatic scrolling or compulsive checking.</li>
<li>Clarifies Intentions: Knowing the purpose behind each digital action&mdash;whether for work, connection, or entertainment&mdash;supports more meaningful use.</li>
<li>Supports Mental Wellbeing: Awareness helps detect negative effects, such as stress or anxiety linked to digital experiences, and prompts timely interventions or boundary-setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s DigComp 2.2 framework highlights &ldquo;digital self-regulation&rdquo; as a key component of digital competence. It refers to the ability to manage screen time, avoid excessive use, and engage with technology in conscious, reflective ways (Vuorikari et al., 2022).<br><br>For educators and managers, this awareness extends beyond personal behaviour. It can help model healthy habits in classrooms and workplaces&mdash;whether by encouraging focused work periods, reducing digital interruptions, or promoting regular breaks. <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/education-and-training/digital-transformation-education/digital-competence-framework-citizens-digcomp/digcomp-framework_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>

<p><strong>Start small:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Track your screen time for one week and reflect on your most and least satisfying uses.</li>
<li>Pause before opening an app: What is your intention?</li>
<li>Pay attention to how you feel&mdash; before, during, and after digital engagement.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><br>1.4 Myths and Misconceptions about Digital Wellbeing</h2>
<p>Although digital wellbeing is gaining more attention, many people still misunderstand what it really means. These misconceptions can prevent us from making healthy and informed choices. In this topic, we&rsquo;ll explore ten common myths&mdash;and what the research actually says. <a href="https://screenspireblog.com/?p=2198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://rijularora.com/blog/mythsarounddigitalwellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<h3>1. &ldquo;Digital wellness is only for people with unhealthy media habits.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In truth, digital wellness is relevant for everyone. Our relationship with media changes over time and should be regularly reflected on&mdash;regardless of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; our current habits seem.</p>
<h3>2. &ldquo;If I need lots of screen time, digital wellness isn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Digital wellness isn&rsquo;t about cutting screen time; it&rsquo;s about using technology intentionally. Even if your work requires 10+ hours online, small changes&mdash;like reducing distractions or improving focus&mdash;can make a big difference.</p>
<h3>3. &ldquo;I have to delete all social media and follow strict routines.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Not at all. Digital wellness isn&rsquo;t about extreme changes. It&rsquo;s about building sustainable habits at your own pace. You don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;do it all&rdquo;&mdash;you just need to do what works for you.</p>
<h3>4. &ldquo;Technology is bad.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Technology is a tool - it has both risks and benefits. The goal of digital wellness is to help us understand and manage both, based on our personal needs and values.</p>
<h3>5. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about reducing screen time.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Screen time matters, but the quality of that time matters more. Two hours of online learning isn&rsquo;t the same as two hours of mindless scrolling. Intentional use is key.</p>
<h3>6. &ldquo;Digital wellness only affects mental health.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Practicing digital wellness also supports sleep, posture, eye health, relationships, communication skills, and productivity.</p>
<h3>7.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need new devices to practice digital wellness.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>No purchases necessary. Many helpful changes&mdash;like turning off notifications or using grayscale mode&nbsp;- can be made with the device you already have.</p>
<h3>8. &ldquo;Digital wellness has no scientific basis.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Emerging research shows promising links between intentional tech use and better sleep, focus, and social connection.</p>
<h3>9.&nbsp; &ldquo;Digital wellness harms productivity.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Actually, it supports productivity by improving focus, reducing digital clutter, and helping us rest better.</p>
<h3>10. &ldquo;Digital wellness looks the same for everyone.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all. Your approach should reflect your lifestyle, goals, and values. What works for a student might not work for a full-time educator or manager&mdash;and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Thought</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever believed one of these myths yourself?</li>
<li>Which one do you still struggle with today?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these misconceptions is the first step toward making better digital choices&mdash;for yourself, your colleagues, and your learners.<br><br></p>

<li>Foundation for Change: Awareness helps identify patterns, triggers, and emotions tied to digital behaviour, enabling individuals to make informed adjustments.</li>
<li>Combats Automatic Use: Many people engage with devices out of habit or impulse. Mindful recognition of this tendency helps disrupt automatic scrolling or compulsive checking.</li>
<li>Clarifies Intentions: Knowing the purpose behind each digital action&mdash;whether for work, connection, or entertainment&mdash;supports more meaningful use.</li>
<li>Supports Mental Wellbeing: Awareness helps detect negative effects, such as stress or anxiety linked to digital experiences, and prompts timely interventions or boundary-setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Commission&rsquo;s DigComp 2.2 framework highlights &ldquo;digital self-regulation&rdquo; as a key component of digital competence. It refers to the ability to manage screen time, avoid excessive use, and engage with technology in conscious, reflective ways (Vuorikari et al., 2022).<br><br>For educators and managers, this awareness extends beyond personal behaviour. It can help model healthy habits in classrooms and workplaces&mdash;whether by encouraging focused work periods, reducing digital interruptions, or promoting regular breaks. <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/projects-and-activities/education-and-training/digital-transformation-education/digital-competence-framework-citizens-digcomp/digcomp-framework_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>

<p><strong>Start small:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Track your screen time for one week and reflect on your most and least satisfying uses.</li>
<li>Pause before opening an app: What is your intention?</li>
<li>Pay attention to how you feel&mdash; before, during, and after digital engagement.</li>

<h2><br>1.4 Myths and Misconceptions about Digital Wellbeing</h2>
<p>Although digital wellbeing is gaining more attention, many people still misunderstand what it really means. These misconceptions can prevent us from making healthy and informed choices. In this topic, we&rsquo;ll explore ten common myths&mdash;and what the research actually says. <a href="https://screenspireblog.com/?p=2198" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://rijularora.com/blog/mythsarounddigitalwellness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[Source]</a></p>
<h3>1. &ldquo;Digital wellness is only for people with unhealthy media habits.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In truth, digital wellness is relevant for everyone. Our relationship with media changes over time and should be regularly reflected on&mdash;regardless of how &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; our current habits seem.</p>
<h3>2. &ldquo;If I need lots of screen time, digital wellness isn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Digital wellness isn&rsquo;t about cutting screen time; it&rsquo;s about using technology intentionally. Even if your work requires 10+ hours online, small changes&mdash;like reducing distractions or improving focus&mdash;can make a big difference.</p>
<h3>3. &ldquo;I have to delete all social media and follow strict routines.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Not at all. Digital wellness isn&rsquo;t about extreme changes. It&rsquo;s about building sustainable habits at your own pace. You don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;do it all&rdquo;&mdash;you just need to do what works for you.</p>
<h3>4. &ldquo;Technology is bad.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Technology is a tool - it has both risks and benefits. The goal of digital wellness is to help us understand and manage both, based on our personal needs and values.</p>
<h3>5. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about reducing screen time.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Screen time matters, but the quality of that time matters more. Two hours of online learning isn&rsquo;t the same as two hours of mindless scrolling. Intentional use is key.</p>
<h3>6. &ldquo;Digital wellness only affects mental health.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Practicing digital wellness also supports sleep, posture, eye health, relationships, communication skills, and productivity.</p>
<h3>7.&nbsp; &ldquo;I need new devices to practice digital wellness.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>No purchases necessary. Many helpful changes&mdash;like turning off notifications or using grayscale mode&nbsp;- can be made with the device you already have.</p>
<h3>8. &ldquo;Digital wellness has no scientific basis.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Emerging research shows promising links between intentional tech use and better sleep, focus, and social connection.</p>
<h3>9.&nbsp; &ldquo;Digital wellness harms productivity.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Actually, it supports productivity by improving focus, reducing digital clutter, and helping us rest better.</p>
<h3>10. &ldquo;Digital wellness looks the same for everyone.&rdquo;</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all. Your approach should reflect your lifestyle, goals, and values. What works for a student might not work for a full-time educator or manager&mdash;and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
