<p>In previous units you learned about online risks, privacy settings, and how to share things safely. Now, it is time to look at how manipulation works online. Some scams are easy to recognize, but others are emotional, clever, and very personal. They can appear as helpful advice, expressions of love, urgent warnings, or kind strangers offering support. In this unit you will learn the techniques scammers use, and how to recognize the signs of scams including emotional traps, dangerous links or misleading information. This knowledge gives you both control and confidence online. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Topic 1 - How online scams use feeling to manipulate you</h2>
<p>Some scams do not look like lies &ndash; because they are filled with emotions. <strong>Online scammers</strong> know how to use your emotions against you, they often target feelings like fear, loneliness, or hope to make you act quickly. This is called <strong>emotional manipulation</strong>, and it is very common in romance scams, fake jobs, or urgent &ldquo;help&rdquo; requests.</p>
<h4>There are a few examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>A message like: &ldquo;<em>I saw a video of you&mdash;click here!</em>&rdquo; &rarr; triggers fear or shame.</li>
<li>A post: &ldquo;<em>Earn $500 per day working from home!</em>&rdquo; &rarr; gives hope during hard times.</li>
<li>A profile: &ldquo;<em>You are a beautiful, strong woman. I want to know you better.</em>&rdquo; &rarr; offers love and connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; These messages may not ask for anything at first, so they seem harmless, but they build trust and later the scammers will ask for something:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Can you send me a gift card so I can visit you?</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>I lost my phone&mdash;can I use your account to text my brother?</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>I need help paying a lawyer to get my visa. I will pay you back.</em>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; <strong>Falling for a scam is not about being naive - these tricks are professionally designed!</strong></p>
<h4>How to protect yourself:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Be cautious with strangers who get personal too quickly.</li>
<li>Never send money, photos, or personal info to someone you never met in person.</li>
<li>Use tools like <span style="text-decoration: underline">Reverse Image Search on TinEye</span> to check profile pictures.</li>
<li>Ask a trusted person before replying to anything that feels emotional or urgent.</li>
</ul>
<p>These emotional baits are often just the beginning. Next, scammers may try to trick you into clicking unsafe links or visiting fake websites. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Topic 2 - How to recognize and avoid digital traps</h2>
<p>Scams are often connected to links&mdash;short messages that try to trick you into clicking something or checking something out. These links might look safe, but they can lead you to fake websites, malware, or places designed to steal your personal information.</p>
<h4>Here are some examples:</h4>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;<em>Your Facebook account will be deleted&mdash;verify here.</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;<em>You have won a prize! Claim it now!</em>&rdquo;</li>
<li>A shortened link (like bit.ly/xxxx) with no explanation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Unit 1, you learned about <strong>phishing emails and fake profiles</strong>. Now, let&rsquo;s go deeper and learn <strong>how to examine a link before you click on it:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On a computer: Hover over the link. Check if it leads to a real site (like <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.facebook.com</a></strong>) or a fake one (like <strong><a href="http://facebook-support-login-now.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://facebook-support-login-now.com</a></strong>).</li>
<li>On mobile: Long-press the link to preview the full URL.</li>
<li>If unsure: copy the link and check it using <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search"><strong>Google Safe Browsing.</strong></a></li>
</ul>
<p>🚩</p>
<ul>
<li>Links that ask for login details right away.</li>
<li>Sites with lots of ads, pop-ups, or poor grammar.</li>
<li>URLs with strange spelling or many dashes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Fake links are often used in:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fake job ads</li>
<li>Immigration scams (for example, messages pretending to be from government offices, visa agencies, or immigration lawyers asking for money or personal information)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Support&rdquo; messages from fake government or banks</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Real institutions do not ask for sensitive information through social media links. Always go to official websites and type the link yourself. Checking links is a simple digital habit that protects your data, your money, and your identity. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Topic 3 - How to recognize false or misleading content</h2>
<p>Not all scams are about stealing money. Some are designed to influence your beliefs, manipulate your emotions, or divide communities by spreading false or misleading information. This is known as information manipulation, and it can take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disinformation</strong> &ndash; Intentionally false content shared to deceive.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> &ldquo;This immigrant family received $10,000 from the government for doing nothing!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Misinformation</strong> &ndash; Inaccurate content shared by someone who does not realize it is false.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> An old protest photo posted as if it shows a recent event.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clickbait</strong> &ndash; Sensational or emotionally charged headlines created to attract attention and generate clicks.
<ul>
<li><em>Example:</em> &ldquo;Doctors are furious about this immigrant woman&rsquo;s health secret!&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Deepfakes</strong> &ndash; Artificially generated videos that make it appear as though someone said or did something they never actually did.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Unit 1, you explored these techniques and learned how to critically evaluate content, even when it seems trustworthy or comes from familiar sources.</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>False or manipulated information can fuel fear, hatred, and poor decision-making. It can also be used as a gateway to scams. <strong>For instance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A post announces a government housing giveaway. You follow the link, fill in your personal details, and your identity is stolen.</li>
<li>A fake video goes viral, claiming that women from a certain country are dangerous. Even though it is not true, it spreads anxiety and prejudice.</li>
<li>A message promises fast visas or immigration help, asking for money or personal data, but it is a scam.</li>
<li>A social media post claims you won a prize or scholarship, but it is fake and designed to steal your information.</li>
</ul>
<p>By developing critical thinking skills, you are not only safeguarding yourself&mdash;you are also helping to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect your community from harm. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gamification Activity</h2>
<h3>Activity Title: Branching Scenario</h3>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline">Scenario Setup Overview</span> </strong></p>
<p>You will &ldquo;play&rdquo; through 3 interactive real-life situations, one per topic. At each step, you choose:</p>
<p>1.How the message makes you feel (emotional awareness)</p>
<p>2.If you think the message is real, suspicious, or fake</p>
<p>3.What you would do next (decision-making)&nbsp;</p>
