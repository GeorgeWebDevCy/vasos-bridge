<p>So far we have often mentioned Data Protection Authorities (DPAs), but we have not yet explained what they are or how they work. In this unit we will lift the veil. A DPA is an independent regulator in each EU country that ensures organisations respect privacy and follow GDPR. They act both as watchdogs &mdash; investigating complaints and issuing fines &mdash; and as guides, by advising organisations and educating the public. Without them, GDPR would remain just words on paper. By the end of this unit, you will know what a DPA is, how it works, and what tools it uses.</p>

<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="Module 2 Unit 3 Topic 1" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/Module-2-Unit-3-Topic-1.webp" alt="Module 2 Unit 3 Topic 1" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<h2>Topic 1 - Legal Basis, Status, and Role</h2>
<p>Under the GDPR, every EU country must establish at least one independent supervisory authority, commonly called a Data Protection Authority (DPA). The legal basis for DPAs is found in Articles 51&ndash;59 GDPR. These provisions define their independence, powers, and responsibilities. Independence is crucial: a DPA cannot take instructions from government ministries or political actors when carrying out its duties. This ensures that citizens&rsquo; rights are protected without political interference.</p>
<p>The DPA&rsquo;s role is multifaceted. First, it ensures that data controllers (organisations deciding how data is used) and processors (those handling data on behalf of others) comply with GDPR. It does so by monitoring practices, handling complaints, and investigating possible violations. Second, the DPA provides guidance and education. It issues advice to businesses, public authorities, and the general public about how to apply GDPR in practical terms. For instance, a hospital might seek guidance on how to protect patient files, or a small business might ask how to set up lawful cookie banners.</p>
<p>In addition, DPAs encourage the development of codes of conduct and certification schemes that organisations can follow to show compliance. They also promote public awareness so that individuals know their rights, such as the right to access or delete their personal data.<br data-start="1367" data-end="1370">The role of the DPA is therefore both reactive and proactive: reactive in investigating and sanctioning violations, but proactive in supporting compliance and shaping best practices. This dual function strengthens trust between individuals and organisations, ensuring personal data is processed responsibly across society.</p>

<h2>Topic 2 - Key Powers and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>DPAs have strong powers under the GDPR, giving them the tools they need to enforce compliance and protect citizens&rsquo; rights. These powers fall into three broad categories: investigatory, corrective, and advisory.</p>
<p>Investigatory powers allow a DPA to examine whether an organisation is complying with GDPR. A DPA can order controllers and processors to provide information, carry out audits, access premises, and review data protection policies. This helps them uncover both technical and organisational failures, such as weak IT security or insufficient staff training.</p>
<p>Corrective powers come into play when a DPA finds non-compliance. These powers are wide-ranging. The DPA can issue warnings for potential risks, reprimands for actual infringements, or order specific corrective actions, such as deleting unlawfully collected data or suspending processing operations. One of the strongest corrective tools is the ability to impose administrative fines &mdash; up to &euro;20 million or 4% of a company&rsquo;s global annual turnover, whichever is higher. This ensures even the largest corporations take compliance seriously. Famous cases include multimillion-euro fines against tech giants for unlawful data processing or lack of valid cookie consent.</p>
<p>Advisory powers are equally important. DPAs provide guidance to organisations, approve certain high-risk processing operations, and oversee certification mechanisms. They may also consult with national legislatures and regulators to ensure that new laws and policies align with GDPR.</p>
<p>Crucially, DPAs are also the first point of contact for individuals. If a person believes their data rights have been violated &mdash; for example, if a company refuses to delete their data upon request &mdash; they can file a complaint with their local DPA. The authority must investigate and respond, giving individuals a direct channel for enforcing their rights without needing to go to court.</p>

<h2>Topic 3 - Cross-Border Cases and Cooperation</h2>
<p>In today&rsquo;s digital economy, personal data often flows across national borders. A company might process data in multiple EU states, run central servers in one country, and provide services to users across Europe. To avoid contradictory enforcement, the GDPR created the &ldquo;One-Stop Shop&rdquo; mechanism for cross-border processing cases.</p>
<p>Under this system, one DPA acts as the lead supervisory authority. This is usually the authority in the country where the company has its &ldquo;main establishment&rdquo; &mdash; the place where key decisions about data processing are made. For example, if a social media company has its European headquarters in Ireland, the Irish Data Protection Commission will usually be the lead DPA.</p>
<p>Other DPAs in countries where people are affected are known as &ldquo;concerned supervisory authorities.&rdquo; They work with the lead authority to investigate, provide input, and ensure the decision reflects the interests of all affected Member States. The cooperation process is overseen by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which helps maintain consistency across Europe. If DPAs disagree, the EDPB can issue binding decisions.</p>
<p>This mechanism is crucial because it prevents companies from facing conflicting rulings in different countries. It also ensures efficient enforcement in complex, large-scale cases. However, it has also been criticised for being slow, as seen in lengthy investigations into major tech platforms.</p>
<p>For individuals, the system offers clarity: they can always complain to their local DPA, even if the organisation is based elsewhere. Their complaint will be forwarded through the cooperation mechanism. This ensures that no matter where a company is located, EU residents&rsquo; data protection rights are enforceable across borders.</p>
