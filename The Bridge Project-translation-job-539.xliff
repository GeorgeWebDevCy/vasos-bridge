<p>Hybrid work has transformed the way organisations operate, offering both new opportunities and complex sustainability challenges. This unit explores how hybrid working models influence environmental responsibility, organisational strategy, and global sustainability goals. Learners will analyse how remote and in-office work patterns affect carbon emissions, digital infrastructure, and employee well-being. The unit also connects hybrid work to broader sustainability frameworks, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.1 Environmental sustainability in hybrid working models</h2>
<p>In the framework of the Hybrid Work, and at a time when our planet faces what the UN calls a &ldquo;code red for humanity&rdquo;, sustainability has become an urgent priority rather than a distant aspiration. As defined by IGI Global, sustainability is &ldquo;the ability to maintain or support a process continuously over time&rdquo; (Verma &amp; Popescu, 2021).</p>
<p>To understand sustainability in a business context, we refer to its three foundational pillars&mdash;People, Planet, and Profit (CFI Team, 2023). These dimensions are interconnected and equally vital to the health of an organisation and society as a whole:</p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="5.4 Unit 4 - Environmental sustainability in hybrid working models" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/5.4-Unit-4-Environmental-sustainability-in-hybrid-working-models.webp" alt="5.4 Unit 4 - Environmental sustainability in hybrid working models" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>Balancing these three pillars is a dynamic process. As the business landscape evolves, organisations must continuously adapt their operations and strategies to sustain long-term value creation.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this transformation. Practically overnight, remote and hybrid work shifted from being a luxury to a necessity for organisational survival. While initially implemented as a short-term response, many SMEs discovered lasting benefits: higher employee satisfaction, reduced overhead costs, and greater flexibility.</p>
<p>During the first lockdowns, the world also witnessed a striking environmental shift&mdash;global CO₂ emissions dropped by 17% in April 2020 compared with 2019 levels. Yet this decline was temporary, as emissions rebounded once economic activity resumed. The experience, however, demonstrated the potential link between work models and environmental impact (Qu&eacute;r&eacute; et al., 2020).</p>
<p>This leads to a critical question: Can hybrid working contribute to sustainable business models&mdash;especially for SMEs? According to HSBC (2021), hybrid work presents compelling advantages (HSBC, 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li>77% of high-growth companies report increased productivity.<br><br></li>
<li>66% believe it supports expansion into new markets.<br><br></li>
<li>66% say hybrid work improves their ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance.<br><br></li>
<li>69% view hybrid work as beneficial for the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, hybrid work embodies a smart and sustainable balance between human well-being, economic efficiency, and environmental responsibility &ndash; bringing the People, Planet, Profit triad to life in the digital workplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4.2 Environmental Impact of Hybrid Work</h2>
<p>The shift to hybrid and remote work has been hailed as a potential environmental game-changer. Yet, as experts point out, the reality is more complex than the popular &ldquo;working from home saves the planet&rdquo; narrative. To understand the true impact, we need to examine the environmental benefits and trade-offs of different work models.</p>
<p>While remote and hybrid work can reduce commuting-related emissions, the overall environmental benefit depends on where and how work happens. Experts interviewed by Allwork.Space (2025) emphasise that savings from fewer car journeys can be offset by increased residential energy use, digital infrastructure demands, and longer-term lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Dr. Arpit Gupta (New York University) notes that &ldquo;emissions decline when fewer people commute daily, but total energy use often shifts to homes.&rdquo; Heating, cooling, and powering multiple remote workspaces may cancel out some of the gains made from reduced traffic. Moreover, employees working from home often move further from city centres, increasing travel distances for non-work activities&mdash;a phenomenon known as the &ldquo;rebound effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another key factor is digital energy consumption. With video conferencing, streaming, and cloud storage surging, data centres now contribute significantly to global electricity demand. As one expert concluded, &ldquo;Remote work is not automatically sustainable&mdash;it depends on infrastructure efficiency and user behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the experts agree that hybrid models offer the most balanced approach. By combining remote flexibility with optimised office operations&mdash;such as smaller, energy-efficient spaces&mdash;companies can reduce emissions without overloading household systems. As organisations modernise their real estate and IT infrastructure, hybrid work can become a genuine driver of carbon reduction (Michaelides &amp; Michaelides, 2025).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Quantitative evidence reinforces the potential of hybrid models (Dropdesk, 2024):</h3>
<ul>
<li>Working remotely half-time can cut an individual&rsquo;s carbon footprint by 1,200 pounds per year (Harvard Business Review).<br><br></li>
<li>In the United States alone, employees working 2&ndash;3 days per week remotely could save over 100 million tons of CO₂ annually (Global Workplace Analytics).<br><br></li>
<li>90% of organisations view hybrid work as a key pillar of their sustainability strategy (JLL).<br><br></li>
<li>Remote work has already saved 67 million metric tons of CO₂ globally, equivalent to taking 14 million cars off the road for a year (Longitude).<br><br></li>
<li>Hybrid and remote arrangements help companies shrink their real estate footprint by up to 30%, balancing both energy efficiency and land use (JLL).<br><br></li>
<li>According to Accenture, hybrid work directly supports progress toward ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) and carbon reduction targets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>4.3 Hybrid work and its Contribution to SDGs</h2>
<p>The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a global commitment to end poverty, safeguard the planet, and ensure prosperity and well-being for all people. Established in 2015 as part of the United Nations&rsquo; 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, these 17 Goals form a comprehensive framework for promoting inclusive growth and environmental responsibility over a 15-year period.</p>
<p>For the first time in history, all UN Member States agreed on a shared vision for global progress&mdash;one that connects social, economic, and environmental dimensions of development. The SDGs are interdependent, meaning that advances in one area often support progress in others.</p>
<p>Achieving these goals requires collective action across society. Governments, businesses, civil organisations, and international institutions are all called upon to collaborate, innovate, and align their efforts toward a more equitable and sustainable future for everyone, everywhere (United Nations, n.d.).</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify">4.4 Hybrid work and its Contribution ESG Strategies</h2>
<h3>Understanding ESG</h3>
<p>As introduced in Chapter 3.1, the concept of ESG &ndash; Environmental, Social, and Governance &ndash; provides a comprehensive framework for assessing an organisation&rsquo;s sustainability and ethical performance. It reflects how companies balance their responsibilities toward the planet, people, and governance structures that guide decision-making. In this section, we revisit ESG briefly to explore how its three dimensions connect specifically to hybrid work practices. ESG is not just a moral imperative; it is becoming a strategic advantage. Companies that monitor and improve their ESG performance are more attractive to investors, clients, and employees.</p>
<p>The relevance of ESG continues to grow, especially as Millennials and Generation Z&mdash;who prioritise environmental and social values&mdash;will make up 72% of the global workforce by 2029 (compared to 52% in 2019). These generations expect employers to take measurable action on sustainability, inclusion, and transparency. Ignoring ESG metrics risks falling behind both ethically and competitively (Wyman, n.d.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Environmental: Hybrid Work and the Planet</h3>
<p>Hybrid work can contribute directly to a company&rsquo;s environmental goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced commuting means fewer carbon emissions and less air pollution.<br><br></li>
<li>Lower office occupancy cuts waste and energy use, especially if digital systems replace paper-based processes.<br><br></li>
<li>Smart building technology&mdash;such as zoned energy systems or automated lighting and HVAC controls&mdash;can further reduce office consumption.<br><br></li>
<li>At home, employees can support sustainability by using smart meters, energy-efficient devices, or improved insulation in their workspaces.<br><br></li>
<li>Organisations might also explore carbon offset programs or employee incentives to encourage eco-friendly behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Social: People and Well-being</h3>
<p>Hybrid work also reinforces the social dimension of ESG, improving well-being, inclusivity, and work-life balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows employees to manage personal responsibilities while maintaining productivity, reducing stress and burnout.<br><br></li>
<li>Flexible work models enable organisations to hire diverse talent, including working parents, people with disabilities, and professionals from different regions.<br><br></li>
<li>Collaboration tools help teams communicate and innovate across physical and digital environments, strengthening trust and connection.<br><br></li>
<li>Ultimately, hybrid work fosters a culture of belonging, flexibility, and personal development, aligning directly with social sustainability goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Governance: Leadership and Accountability</h3>
<p>According to McKinsey, governance refers to the internal systems of practices, controls, and procedures that guide decision-making and ensure accountability within an organisation. Strong governance ensures compliance with laws, ethical conduct, and transparency toward stakeholders.</p>
<p>Hybrid work can enhance governance by prompting organisations to modernise internal processes, strengthen data security and health measures, and redefine accountability for both remote and on-site employees. Clear policies, transparent communication, and digital oversight tools help SMEs make governance more resilient and effective&mdash;building trust while supporting sustainable value creation (McKinsey, 2020).</p>

In this section, we revisit ESG briefly to explore how its three dimensions connect specifically to hybrid work practices. ESG is not just a moral imperative; it is becoming a strategic advantage. Companies that monitor and improve their ESG performance are more attractive to investors, clients, and employees.</p>
<p>The relevance of ESG continues to grow, especially as Millennials and Generation Z&mdash;who prioritise environmental and social values&mdash;will make up 72% of the global workforce by 2029 (compared to 52% in 2019). These generations expect employers to take measurable action on sustainability, inclusion, and transparency. Ignoring ESG metrics risks falling behind both ethically and competitively (Wyman, n.d.).</p>

<h3>Environmental: Hybrid Work and the Planet</h3>
<p>Hybrid work can contribute directly to a company&rsquo;s environmental goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced commuting means fewer carbon emissions and less air pollution.<br><br></li>
<li>Lower office occupancy cuts waste and energy use, especially if digital systems replace paper-based processes.<br><br></li>
<li>Smart building technology&mdash;such as zoned energy systems or automated lighting and HVAC controls&mdash;can further reduce office consumption.<br><br></li>
<li>At home, employees can support sustainability by using smart meters, energy-efficient devices, or improved insulation in their workspaces.<br><br></li>
<li>Organisations might also explore carbon offset programs or employee incentives to encourage eco-friendly behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Social: People and Well-being</h3>
<p>Hybrid work also reinforces the social dimension of ESG, improving well-being, inclusivity, and work-life balance.</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows employees to manage personal responsibilities while maintaining productivity, reducing stress and burnout.<br><br></li>
<li>Flexible work models enable organisations to hire diverse talent, including working parents, people with disabilities, and professionals from different regions.<br><br></li>
<li>Collaboration tools help teams communicate and innovate across physical and digital environments, strengthening trust and connection.<br><br></li>
<li>Ultimately, hybrid work fosters a culture of belonging, flexibility, and personal development, aligning directly with social sustainability goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Governance: Leadership and Accountability</h3>
<p>According to McKinsey, governance refers to the internal systems of practices, controls, and procedures that guide decision-making and ensure accountability within an organisation. Strong governance ensures compliance with laws, ethical conduct, and transparency toward stakeholders.</p>
<p>Hybrid work can enhance governance by prompting organisations to modernise internal processes, strengthen data security and health measures, and redefine accountability for both remote and on-site employees. Clear policies, transparent communication, and digital oversight tools help SMEs make governance more resilient and effective&mdash;building trust while supporting sustainable value creation (McKinsey, 2020).</p>
