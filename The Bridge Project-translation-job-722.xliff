When an organisation collects your personal data, you have the right to know what they do with it. This is known as the &lt;strong&gt;Right to Be Informed&lt;/strong&gt;. You also have the &lt;strong&gt;Right of Access&lt;/strong&gt;, which means you can ask to see the personal data they hold about you. These rights help you understand and take control of how your data is used. This is especially important when you give information to places like schools, hospitals, or job centres.

In this unit, you will learn how to request your data and understand what is being done with your personal information.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 1 - The right to be informed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Right to Be Informed&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most important rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is explained in &lt;strong&gt;Article 13 and Article 14&lt;/strong&gt; of the GDPR and ensures transparency and fairness. This right helps you understand what is happening with your personal data.

&lt;strong&gt;
It’s not just about knowing that your data is being used—you also have the right to know:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;why it is being used,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;how long it will be kept,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;who it is shared with,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;how to contact the organisation, and&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;what your other rights are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This information is usually provided in a privacy notice, which should be easy to read and understand.

&lt;strong&gt;
Examples:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;If you visit a doctor or hospital, they should explain how they use your health data, who can see it (for example, a pharmacy), and how long your records will be kept.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;If you fill out a job application online, the company must tell you what data they collect (like your name, phone number, and work history) and how they will use it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
If your data is collected directly from you, the organisation must give you this information at the time they collect it (&lt;strong&gt;Article 13&lt;/strong&gt;) and if your data is collected from another source, they must inform you within one month or before contacting you (&lt;strong&gt;Article 14&lt;/strong&gt;).

This right helps you make informed decisions. If you know what an organisation does with your data, you can choose whether to share it, or even ask them to stop.

&amp;nbsp;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 2 - The right of access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The right of access&lt;/strong&gt; is set out in the GDPR, in &lt;strong&gt;Article 15&lt;/strong&gt;. This right means you can ask any organisation—such as a hospital, school, employer, or website—if they are using your personal data. They must give you an answer. You can also ask to see the personal data they have about you.

This is often called a &lt;strong&gt;Subject Access Request (SAR)&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;strong&gt;
What can you ask for? What must they give you?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;A copy of your personal data&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Information about why they are using it&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The types of data they hold (e.g. name, email, photo, medical records)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Who they share it with&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;How long they will keep it&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Where they got it from (if not directly from you)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The organisation must respond to you within one month and free of charge. However, there are some exceptions — for example, if your request is very large or repeated many times, you might need to pay a fee. If more time is needed to process your request (for example, if it is complex), the organisation can take up to two more months, but they must explain why. To keep your data safe, they might also ask you to confirm your identity.

&lt;strong&gt;
Example:&lt;/strong&gt;

You worked at a company for three years and now you want to know what personal data they still have about you. You can write an email saying:

&lt;em&gt; “I want to make a subject access request under Article 15 of the GDPR. Please send me a copy of all the personal data you have about me.” &lt;/em&gt;

You do not need to give a reason - this is your right.
