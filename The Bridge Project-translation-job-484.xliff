width="auto" height="auto"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Unit 2, where we transition from institutional policies to the fundamental role of human interaction in the online or hybrid environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While technology provides the platform and safeguarding policies provide the rules, safety in an online environment is ultimately created by human behavior. We must actively educate ourselves on what constitutes acceptable, recommended, and unacceptable behavior. This unit establishes the critical understanding that a safe learning space starts with intentional, agreed-upon actions&amp;mdash;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen by accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus is developing a clear training contract. This contract moves beyond vague etiquette by formally setting clear rules of engagement, eliminating behaviors that make others feel unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Topic 1 Behavior as Foundation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section establishes the core philosophical principle of safety in the digital classroom. Safe space online is created by human behavior, not by software. Unlike a physical classroom, the online environment relies heavily on participants&amp;rsquo; self-regulation and adherence to established norms. Because behavior is learned, the responsibility lies with the educator to actively and explicitly teach and reinforce acceptable and unacceptable actions. This moves us from an assumption of safety to the proactive creation of a low-risk environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For adult educators working with migrant and refugee women, creating a low-risk environment is paramount. Many learners come from contexts where vulnerability and surveillance are daily realities. A seemingly small violation of digital etiquette&amp;mdash;such as a participant forgetting to mute, leading to personal conversations being overheard&amp;mdash;can instantly shatter trust and psychological safety. Therefore, we must collectively educate ourselves on behaviors that guarantee every participant feels secure and respected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This starts with an honest self-assessment. The Reflection Exercise: What makes you feel safe/unsafe online? encourages trainers to empathize with their learners. Does an unmuted microphone feel distracting, or does it feel intrusive? Does a video being suddenly turned off feel rude, or does it signal a vital need for privacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 2 The Training Contract: Operationalizing Safety and Agency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is the practical application of Unit 2.1's philosophical foundation. The training contract moves safety from an abstract ideal to an operational document that governs interaction. Its primary pedagogical function is to eliminate behaviors because of which others will not feel safe, thereby guaranteeing psychological security for our adult learners, particularly migrant and refugee women who may be acutely sensitive to unpredictable environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is designed to be a tool of empowerment and mutual accountability. Instead of rules being imposed solely by the educator, the process focuses on collaborative drafting of a 'Living Contract.' This co-creation model is vital for adult education, shifting the dynamics from passive compliance to active ownership. By asking learners, "What behaviors do you need from us&amp;mdash;and from each other&amp;mdash;to feel safe and able to speak?" we grant them agency and ensure the standards are culturally relevant and truly address their specific safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract must clearly communicate the agreed behavior standards, dividing them into, general information and two explicit categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acceptable behaviors:&lt;/strong&gt; These promote inclusivity and equity. Examples like "Waiting for someone to stop talking" and "Ask everyone to speak" (implemented via round or designated speaking queues) directly counteract the tendency for dominant participants to take over, ensuring quieter learners, especially those with developing language skills, have guaranteed airtime and feel valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unacceptable Behaviors:&lt;/strong&gt; These eliminate specific digital risks and distractions. Prohibiting actions like sharing the link and inviting people from outside the class is a non-negotiable security measure. Stating that not muting when someone else is talking is unacceptable turns poor etiquette into a breach of the safe space, allowing the trainer to address it firmly, non-personally, and immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract transforms potential disciplinary moments into learning opportunities. When a rule is broken, the trainer does not criticize the individual; they refer back to the shared agreement. This objective enforcement builds trainer integrity and reinforces the idea that the contract is there to protect everyone, fostering a predictable and trust-filled environment essential for deep cognitive engagement. This contract is the engine of the safe space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topic 3 Respectful Communication and Consistent Enforcement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concluding section of Unit 2 focuses on mastering the delicate skill of respectful communication and consistent enforcement. Our goal is to equip educators with the practical ability to address non-compliant behavior in a manner that firmly maintains the security of the safe space contract while always preserving the learner's dignity. In an online environment with vulnerable migrant and refugee women, an educator's enforcement must be an act of care, not control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central principle guiding this section is respectful confrontation&amp;mdash;the art of correcting behavior without shaming the individual. Addressing unacceptable behaviors, like multitasking or non-muting, is necessary because poorly handled disruptions can instantly destroy the trust and psychological safety established with the group. However, if correction is handled poorly, it can be damaging. Therefore, trainers must prioritize neutral, non-judgmental language. Instead of personal critique, the feedback must focus on the behavior&amp;rsquo;s impact on the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, an effective intervention focuses on the observable behavior and the rule: "I notice your microphone is open, and we hear background noise. The Contract asks that all microphones remain muted when not speaking to ensure active listening for everyone." This language reframes the issue&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not the learner disobeying the trainer; it&amp;rsquo;s the behavior violating the group's agreed-upon safety standard. This mechanism depersonalizes the conflict and empowers the training Contract as the ultimate authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, consistency of enforcement is the bedrock of building trust and predictability in a low-risk environment. The rules must be applied fairly to everyone, every time. When a rule is breached, the educator's first move should be to address it immediately, specifically, and often privately (using a private chat message first, if appropriate).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make these skills immediately usable, participants engage in Role-Playing Scenarios. They practice using scripts built around the "I noticed..." and "The Contract asks that..." framework. They also develop a "3-Step Corrective Script" for common breaches&amp;mdash;like chronic non-muting&amp;mdash;ensuring they have a dignity-preserving, immediately usable process to follow. This practice guarantees that the enforcement process itself reinforces the respectful, inclusive environment the entire unit aims to establish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamification Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Activity Title: Training contract, drag and drop activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This activity, designed as a quick Drag and Drop help to correctly differentiate accepted and unaccepted&amp;nbsp;behaviors during online education session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please sort the following 12 behaviors into the correct category:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: center"&gt;[h5p id="53"]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
