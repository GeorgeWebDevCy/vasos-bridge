<p>When we think about GDPR, we often imagine websites, apps, and online forms. But the rules of data protection don&rsquo;t stop at the computer screen &mdash; they are just as present in the physical world around us. Every time you swipe a loyalty card at the supermarket, fill out a paper form at the doctor&rsquo;s office, withdraw money from an ATM, or walk into a shopping mall with security cameras, personal data is being collected and processed.</p>
<p>For migrant women, these are everyday situations that can sometimes feel confusing or even intrusive, especially when information is requested without much explanation. This unit explores how GDPR applies in these physical spaces: what companies and institutions are allowed to do, what limits exist, and how you can stay in control of your information. The goal is not to make you suspicious of every camera or form, but to help you recognise your rights and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Cards, Clubs, and Coupons - How Memberships Collect Your Data</h2>
<p>When you sign up for a loyalty or membership card, you are usually asked to give personal details: your name, address, phone number, sometimes your birthday. In return, you get points, discounts, or access to services. On the surface, it looks like a fair deal. But GDPR also sets other important rules beyond &ldquo;only what&rsquo;s necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of these is the principle of storage limitation: your data cannot be kept forever. A supermarket may need your shopping history to calculate this month&rsquo;s discounts, but it cannot store your entire purchase record from ten years ago. If you cancel your membership, they should delete your details within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Another rule is transparency. Companies must explain in simple, clear language what they are doing with your data. If the terms are so complicated that you would need a lawyer to decode them, they&rsquo;re not really respecting GDPR. You have the right to ask questions like: Who sees my information? How long will you keep it? Will it be shared with anyone else? And they must answer.</p>
<p>There is also the principle of integrity and confidentiality &ndash; in everyday words, this means security. If you give your bank details to a gym to set up direct payments, they must store them safely. GDPR requires companies to protect data against accidental loss or misuse. That means no leaving paper forms lying around on a counter, no unsecured spreadsheets with everyone&rsquo;s details, and no &ldquo;open access&rdquo; for staff who don&rsquo;t need to see your file.</p>
<p>Finally, GDPR gives you the right to withdraw consent at any time. Imagine you signed up for a bookstore membership and agreed to receive their newsletters. If you later decide the emails are too frequent, you can opt out. The store must respect your choice and still let you keep your card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>ATMs and Paper Forms</h2>
<p>Even traditional services like withdrawing cash at an ATM or filling out a paper form at the doctor&rsquo;s office involve data processing &ndash; and GDPR applies here, too.</p>
<p>Every time you use your bank card, a lot of details are recorded: not just the amount of money, but also the time, the place, and which machine you used. Some banks even use extra checks like fingerprints or face scans for security. GDPR sees this as very sensitive information, so banks and payment companies must protect it carefully.</p>
<p>Since May 2018, they have been required to follow strict rules: your data can only be used for banking and fraud prevention, it must be stored securely, and it cannot be passed on to others for unrelated purposes. If a company doesn&rsquo;t follow these rules, the fines can be huge &ndash; up to &euro;20 million or 4% of their worldwide income.</p>
<p>Banks must follow GDPR rules when handling ATM data. They can only use your information for legal reasons, for example, to complete your withdrawal or to prevent fraud. All records must be kept safe and secure, not shared for advertising, and not stored longer than necessary (usually just days or weeks).</p>
<p>You also have rights: you can ask the bank for your transaction records, request corrections if something is wrong, and even ask if camera footage exists. If data is no longer needed, you can request deletion (unless the law requires it to be kept). The bank must answer you within one month and explain things clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If you withdraw &euro;100 but are charged &euro;200, you can ask the bank for all the records of that transaction to get it fixed.<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 6" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-6.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 6" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>ATMs and Paper Forms</h2>
<p>Filling in paper forms may feel old-fashioned, but GDPR protects you here just as much as online. Whether it&rsquo;s at the doctor&rsquo;s office, the local school, or even at the supermarket when you apply for a discount card, those forms collect your personal data &mdash; your name, address, phone number, maybe even your date of birth.</p>
<p>Under GDPR, organisations must keep those forms safe. They shouldn&rsquo;t be left lying on the reception desk where anyone can read them, and only the right staff should have access. If the forms are later scanned into a computer system, the digital copies should also be protected and deleted when they are no longer needed.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you sign a paper form in a supermarket to get a loyalty card. It asks for your name, email, and birthday. That can make sense if the store wants to send you birthday discounts. But if the form also asks for your tax ID number, that would be suspicious: GDPR requires companies to explain why they need each piece of data, and they are not allowed to ask for more than is necessary.</p>
<p>For migrant women, this is especially important because forms are often in a language that can feel difficult or confusing. GDPR gives you the right to transparency: you can ask why each detail is needed, how it will be used, and how long it will be kept. If the answer is not clear, that&rsquo;s a warning sign.</p>
<p>The bottom line: whether it&rsquo;s a medical form, a school application, or a loyalty card at your favourite shop, GDPR ensures your data is not just taken and forgotten. You have the right to know where it goes, who sees it, and when it will be thrown away.<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 6" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-6-1.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 6" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lights, Camera, Action &ndash; Being Filmed in Public Spaces</h2>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 7" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-7.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 7" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>These days, it feels like cameras are everywhere. You walk into a shopping mall, a supermarket, a train station, or even the entrance of some apartment buildings, and there&rsquo;s usually a little sign with a black-and-white camera symbol: &ldquo;CCTV in operation.&rdquo; Sometimes it even says: &ldquo;By entering, you agree to being filmed.&rdquo; But what does that really mean? Do you suddenly give away your privacy just by walking through the door?</p>
<p>Not exactly. GDPR applies here too, and it makes sure that video surveillance cannot just be used without limits. Owners of shops, malls, or residential buildings must be clear about why they are filming. A common reason is to prevent theft or ensure safety. That&rsquo;s considered a legitimate interest under GDPR. But they cannot film just because they &ldquo;feel like it,&rdquo; and they certainly cannot point cameras into places where you have a reasonable expectation of privacy, like bathrooms, changing rooms, or staff break areas.</p>
<p>Transparency is key. That small sign at the entrance should do more than just warn you, it should tell you who is responsible for the cameras and how to contact them if you have questions. In many countries, if you want to know whether you were recorded, you can request access to the footage under your GDPR right of access. Of course, this has limits: the shop can&rsquo;t hand you hours of recordings that also show hundreds of other people. But if there was a specific incident involving you, you are allowed to ask for relevant footage.</p>
<p>GDPR&rsquo;s storage limitation principle means that personal data, including security camera recordings, cannot be kept indefinitely &ldquo;just in case.&rdquo; For example, data protection authorities like Luxembourg&rsquo;s CNPD recommend that video surveillance footage be kept for no longer than 8 days under normal circumstances, with a maximum of 30 days only in exceptional cases where it is justified.</p>
<p>This limitation is crucial because long-term storage creates serious risks: the longer personal data or footage is held, the higher the possibility of misuse, unauthorized access, leaks, or theft. There have been real-world incidents where old CCTV footage was hacked and leaked online, exposing sensitive personal information and violating people&rsquo;s privacy rights.</p>
<p>A real example of why CCTV rules matter comes from the UK in May 2025. Greater Manchester Police were officially reprimanded after losing two hours of important CCTV footage while a suspect was in custody. The review found they had not stored or protected the recordings properly, which counted as a data breach. The UK&rsquo;s Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office reminded them and everyone else that CCTV often contains very sensitive personal data and must be handled with care.</p>
<p>This is why GDPR&rsquo;s storage limitation rule is so important. It requires organisations to set clear time limits for keeping footage and to delete it once it&rsquo;s no longer needed. That protects people&rsquo;s privacy, reduces the chance of data leaks, and even saves organisations unnecessary costs.<br><br></p>
<p><img style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto" title="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 8" src="http://thebridgeproject.eu/wp-content/uploads/1.3-Unit-3-GDPR-in-Your-Everyday-Life-8.webp" alt="1.3 Unit 3 - GDPR in Your Everyday Life 8" width="auto" height="auto"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under GDPR, CCTV cameras must always be visible and clearly signposted. You should see a notice telling you that recording is taking place, who is responsible for it, and how you can contact them. Hidden cameras are not allowed.</p>
<p>Some recordings are considered especially sensitive. For example, footage of children, patients in hospitals, or people in vulnerable situations requires extra care and stronger protections. Organisations using cameras in these contexts must follow stricter rules to ensure safety and dignity.</p>
<p>For migrant women, this knowledge can be very practical. If you live in shared housing, you have the right to ask where cameras are placed and whether they respect your privacy. If you are ever accused of something in a shop, CCTV footage can actually help prove your innocence &ndash; but only if you know that you have the right to request access. And if you work in a restaurant, warehouse, or cleaning job, remember that cameras should be there for safety reasons, not for spying on how fast you work or how long your break is.</p>
